  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This past Wednesday, in the last of the amazing speaker hackNY guest lecture series, we had the lucky opportunity to listen to team of partners at <a href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a>, composed of many of the biggest names in venture capital on the East (and West) coast. As we progressed through the Q&amp;A session, complemented by a spectular, shimmering view of the setting sun over the Manhattan skyline, someone brought up the inivetible (and important) concern of whether this new start-up acropolis of Manhattan would make it. That is, beyond the hype and the parties and the geek-chic hipster glasses, would this bloom-and-burst of web apps amount to any valueable ecosystem?</p>
<p>Someone answered, and I forget who, that it was <em>exactly</em> these little failures, these short-lived spurts, that <em>lead</em> to a strong and stable economy. He compared it to <a href="http://blog.chaddickerson.com/">Chad Dickerso</a>n, CEO of <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> (also an amazing speaker that we got the chance to listen to on Monday, and head of a company that I have had a huge crush on for years now)'s technical dogma of continuous deployment. At Etsy, engineers are required to continuously deploy-- in other words, push out new code as quickly as possible-- even if that code may not be perfected yet. The code is <em>expected</em> to be flawed and eyes and ears are kept alert to catch and patch up any holes. The argument, which at first appears counter-intuitive, is that this methodology actually leads to a <em>more</em> reliable product, especially for something on the scale of Etsy.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>His words really struck a deep chord inside of me, I guess because the ideas of rapid development and taking risks are themes that come up again and again in the start-up world (as my roommate says, "Make shit break shit"), and sometimes I don't know if it is a mantra that I'd live by. It sounds rather wasteful and reckless. I guess I'm still a bit shook up by the old mantra of "too big to fail", but is "too small to fail" just as bad?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can't agree more with the importance of failure, on both a personal and professional level. Failure is essential to life, it is essential to business, and it is essential to being a human being. Lots of times, I hear about these 20-something year-old guys making it big in Silicon Valley, but I'm more interested in hearing about the innovations they make to float to the top once they've been kicked down.</p>
<p>You may be wondering what right this little Ivy-League girl from small-town Suburbia has to speak of failure, but for many years, it was a steady companion in my life. From the ages of 5 to 15 I dedicated a huge part of my life to rhythmic gymnastics, a Eastern European hybrid of ballet and circus acrobatics, at my peak training more than 20 hours a week. Because school came relatively easily to me, and I like challenges, I considered gymnastics my true career.</p>
<p>The thing was, I wasn't a particularly <em>good</em> gymnast. I did fairly well when I was young (I think I placed 3rd in the state a long time ago), but I just wasn't cut out for it beyond the junior level. I lacked the bitchiness, the guts, and the hand-eye coordination to succeed. Also, I wasn't nearly thin enough or blonde enough, and I was <em>really</em> not Russian. Combine shaky nerves with one really <em>verbal</em> coach who was constantly calling us fat, stupid, ugly and so very <em>American</em> like it was the dirtiest word, and believe you me: when I say I failed, I failed <em>spectacularly</em>. Every competition, I screwed up in more creative ways than you can imagine, on moves I perfected during practice. 8 times out of 10 (I mean, I wasn't <em>that</em> bad), I would make a fool of myself, my coach would give me a death stare, and then I'd go to the bathroom and slap on another sparkly half-nude leotard and feel like shit.</p>
<p>I understand that it wasn't anywhere equivalent to going bankrupt or anything, but I did consider gymnastics my career and it was in many ways my professional life outside of school.</p>
<p>So, in short, a very long tangent to back up a very concise statement: failure does a person good. It makes them humble, sometimes it makes them cynical, but it always makes them a little (or a lot) wiser. I'm not encouraging you to all send your children to training camp now, because I think that self-esteem is important, but still, learn to fail and more importantly, learn to <em>get over it</em>. Never, ever, be too big to fail because, I guarantee, we are all quite small. Just like it can make a steady-state of economy, little failures build a steadier mind.</p>
