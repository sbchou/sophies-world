    <p>To-day in yoga class the girl next to me had a very large and slightly unseemly tattoo on her ankle of a phrase both succinct and wise: What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Who You Are.</p>
<p>This statement struck a deep and harmonious chord inside of me, because I think we are told far too often that What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger, which I feel is a cheap way of sugar-coating hardship and ignoring it for face value. While a lot of times what doesn't kill us does indeed strengthen us, if not physically, then at least in some mental way, it would be a blanket statement to hold this as a universal maxim. Sometimes what doesn't kill us really does weaken us. Sometimes it cripples us, sometimes it blinds us, and sometimes it even breaks us.</p>
<p>To learn and grow from trying times is not necessarily the direct function of the difficulty itself. While there definitely benefit in thinking positive, let's not confuse cause with correlation.</p>
<p>But what doesn't kill us most certainly molds us into who we are, unto death, for better, or for worse.</p>
