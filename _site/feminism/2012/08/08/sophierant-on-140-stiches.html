    <p>Now here I was, sitting at home on a lazy summer's day, full of food and sleep, reading through the NYTimes to find something good and juicy to write about, and thinking maybe, just maybe, that actually none of the articles annoyed me today.</p>
<p>Then aforementioned now ex-roommate Jennifer comes to the rescue (as usual!) with a link to this <a href="http://140stitches.com/2012/8/2/nerds-its-time-to-up-your-fashion-game">appalling post</a>. And I smack myself in the forehead now for forgetting: Silicon Valley's like a gold mine of Sophie-rant material. Put together 99 parts men, one part opinionated woman, and an extremely distorted and sensationalist media, and you have one big recipe for trouble.</p>
<p>Anyway. Apparently <a href="http://www.140stitches.com/">140 Stiches</a> is "dedicated to all you tech nerds who have far more important things to do than care about what the hell you're going to wear. You were gifted in many ways - fashion sense not one of them. That's okay, because I have absolutely nothing better to do than tell you smart asses what to wear." Umm, OFFENSIVE, JUST A LITTLE?</p>
<p>But to cover-up right quick, the author makes sure to clarify that even though she just insulted the pants off your algorithm-loving asses, she's just one of "the boys". "If you think I'm just your average fashion obsessed girly girl, think again. I know my fair share about the interwebs and my favorite movie is The Social Network, in which I may or may not know every line."</p>
<p>Look guys, fashion sites are GREAT. Fashion advice is helpful and fun for those who WANT and need it. But making the bullheaded and unfortunate assumption that all nerds are men and unkept ones at that is not only offensive, it's, well, sexist. To both sexes!  I am a computer scientist and a nerd, but I also happen to be a fashionable metropolitan woman. And I also happen to like my algorithm-writing, bespectacled companions in their hackathon shirts. At least it shows a preference for intelligence over vanity, which not many people these days seem to have.</p>
