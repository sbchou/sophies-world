    <p>Suzanne Venker wants us to surrender to our "nature", our femininity, so that "marriageable men will come out of the woodwork".</p>
<p>I ask: Why use the word surrender? And what the hell are we going to do with all these men waiting on hand and knee to marry us anyway? </p>
<p>Oh, how I wanted to avoid reading her article, "<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/11/24/war-on-men/">the war on men</a>", on fox *cough cough cough* news. Why ruin a lovely Saturday morning? But since it was only about a page long, and I have a very short attention span for these sorts of nonsense, read it I did.</p>
<p>I don't have the time nor fuse to do a thorough reading and analysis of the piece. Nor do I wish to research the author more thoroughly. As such, I will simply give my reaction to a few select quotes. You may form your own opinions and arguments as you please. Me, I have better things to do. </p>
<p><i>Note: the best way to read the following is to insert an explecitive of your choice before every noun. Since this a relatively family/work-friendly blog, I left it out, but feel free to be creative. </i></p>
<p>"Women aren’t women anymore."</p>
<p>Excuse me, I'm pretty sure as long as we have the correct body parts which we may do with as we please and/or identify as female, that is woman enough for me.</p>
<p>"All the articles and books (and television programs, for that matter) put women front and center, while men and children sit in the back seat." </p>
<p>Uh, no. This is just plain incorrect. The percentage of female lead characters (and I mean lead characters, not femme fatales, objects of attraction, love interests) is still relatively small. The percentage of <i>strong</i> female leads, even less.</p>
<p>"Feminism serves men very well: they can have sex at hello and even live with their girlfriends with no responsibilities whatsoever."</p>
<p>To make the assumption that men are driven by their d*cks you might as well assume women are driven by their uteruses. Oh wait...</p>
<p>"Not only are they saddled with the consequences of sex, by dismissing male nature they’re forever seeking a balanced life."</p>
<p>Thanks for saddling us with the consequences of sex. I hope you never saddle anything else of mine.</p>
<p>"Men haven’t changed much – they had no revolution that demanded it – but women have changed dramatically."</p>
<p>Then perhaps it is time for men to undergo some change: learn to appreciate women who are career driven, independent, and maybe someone you can actually have a intelligent conversation with? And perhaps someone who can actually be your partner and equal? </p>
<p>"In a nutshell, women are angry. They’re also defensive, though often unknowingly. That’s because they’ve been raised to think of men as the enemy."</p>
<p>This quote is the one that gets me the most. DO I SEEM ANGRY TO YOU?! </p>
<p>In all seriousness-- maybe women are angry for good reason: maybe anger, like pain, is a necessary evil-- because it keeps us driven, and points to the fact that there are <i>real, concrete</i> issues out there to be angry about. </p>
<p>If women are angry, I hope we stay angry until there is no more to be angry about. Better to be angry and passionate for change and justice than passive and content to settle. </p>
<p>And just for the record, I can be damn feminine when I want to. Maybe I just have other priorities.</p>
