		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Hello, World!</em>
<em></em>Welcome to my new blog! Sitting in a cafe near Union Square &amp; sipping on some iced coconut chai, I figure now is a good time as ever to start posting. Life is good.

<em>Why blog?</em>
This blog was partly inspired by my short-term mentor this summer, Cathy O'Neil, who has a brilliant and witty blog at <a href="http://mathbabe.org/">Mathbabe.org</a>. I have always considered myself a writer at heart (and by that I do not mean a good writer, or even a prolific one; just someone who expresses themselves best via the written word), but as a Computer Scientist in training do not find myself writing as often as I'd like to. For a few years now, I've maintained my food blog, <a href="http://www.mpetitchou.com/">Mon Petit Chou</a>, but other topics (rants &amp; raves, tech stuff, opinion pieces) didn't seem to fit in quite well there.

<em>A little bit about me:</em>
Hello, my name is Sophie. I am a Computer Science major (and hopefully Philosophy minor) at Columbia University's Engineering School. This summer, I am a <a href="http://hackny.org/">hackNY fellows</a> working as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.intentmedia.com/">Intent Media</a>. Am a bit of a feminist, love to read (although have not read as much since I started working), been dancing since I was a little girl, although not professionally/intensly. What else... foodie, cat lover, writer (of course). That's about it.

Oh, by the way, please leave COMMENTS! They're the best part about writing.

<em>Now, for a little bit of nerdspeak:</em>
For you hackers out there, this blog is indeed run on Wordpress. Now, Wordpress is a bit of a hacker's nightmare: php and annoying UI's all over the place. Since my food blog is run on Wordpress, and I knew the faults, I considered creating a static blog using Jekyll (perhaps Octopress or Jekyll-Bootstrap), which are both great because it meant blogging would fit right into my work flow: simply git add, commit, and push, and voila, new post! I'd never have to leave the terminal. However, after tinkering around with it for a while, I realized that, fun as it was, it simply wasn't practical at this time: basically, I wouldn't be able to blog from the remote, and the conviniences of using a pre-packaged software simply outweighted the benefits in the end.

However, do not despair: in the spirit of all things hacky, even though I did sucumb to Wordpress, this blog is actually hosted (for free!) on Heroku, yay! Checkout this awesome repo by mhoofman on Github (<a href="https://github.com/mhoofman/wordpress-heroku">https://github.com/mhoofman/wordpress-heroku</a>). It comes with PostgreSQL for Wordpress pre-installed in order to run on Heroku's Postgres backend, and is easy-peasy as pie to setup.

À bientôt!
Sophie

		<title>Mini Feminist Rant #1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After discovering earlier this year a really simple way of avoiding the New York Time's (very) loosely implemented firewall (which I am not going to tell you, since I am a supporter of the press and really there are quite a few dozen ways to avoid it) I've been following the Opinion pages on a regular basis, especially the "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate">Room for Debate</a>" section, which features different responses to a central question. Usually, these debates are well-rounded and bring me some faith back into the intellect of the human species. Occasionally, though, there is a really unfortunate WTF moment. Case in point, this recent discussion centered on the question "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/12/are-modern-men-manly-enough">Are Modern Men Manly Enough?</a>" Seriously, the description alone is enough to make me vomit: "Are men spending too much time at the spa and the gym in lieu of grittier, manlier pursuits? And if so, is this making them less masculine?" Really, NYT? Really?

Now, this wouldn't have been so bad, if there had been lots of great, insightful responses debunking gender stereotypes etc. Instead, we get pieces titled "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/12/are-modern-men-manly-enough/where-are-the-meat-and-potato-men">Where are the Meat and Potato Men?</a>" and "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/12/are-modern-men-manly-enough/men-need-to-rediscover-the-don-draper-within">Rediscovering the Don Draper Within</a>". Seriously. I'm pretty confident the latter is satire, though, thank Goodness, since I'm crossing my fingers that no one would say "I got messed up by my feminist mom in the 1970s, who taught me that gender was a social construct" with a straight face. But the Meat and Potato Men one looks to be serious, and seriously alarming. Natasha Scripture ends her piece, basically a description of personal dating preferences and how she was turned off by a date that cried to mourn the loss of Maurice Sendak by stating "I hope we don’t become so much like each other that we end up essentially morphing into one androgynous being. That would just be plain weird". I'm a little weirded out myself.

Listen, gender, image, masculinity, and dating are all great topics that are truly worthy of discussion. But do we really need to revert to Mad Men stereotypes (as gripping of a show as that may be) to do so? And if we must, can we at least do it in an enlightened way?]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Basic (Multiple) Linear Regression</h3>

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i,1} + .... + \beta_PX_{i,P} + \epsilon_i$$
<ul>
<li>where $x_{i,p}$ is the value of the $p^{th}$ predictor at for the $i^{th}$ value of y </li>
<li>$\beta_0$ is the regression constant</li>
<li>$\beta_p$ is the coefficient on the $p^{th}$ predictor</li>
<li>P is the total number of predictors</li>
<li>$y_i$ is the predictand of the $i^{th}$ value of y</li>
<li>$e_i$ is the error term</li>
</ul>

aka

$$Y = X\beta + \epsilon$$

where 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\y_2\\.\\.\\.\\y_n\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & ... & x_{1p} \\ 1 & x_{21} & x_{22} & ... & x_{2p}\\  & & & ... & & & \\ & & & ... & & &\\ 1 & x_{n1} & x_{n2} & ... & x_{np}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}\beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \\... \\... \\... \\ \beta_p    \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon_1\\\epsilon_2\\.\\.\\.\\\epsilon_n\end{bmatrix}
$$

**<i>Note: knowledge of Linear Algebra based on Wikipedia</i>

<h3>We want to solve for the coefficients $\beta$</h3>
where 
$$
\beta = (X^{\top}X)^{-1}X^{\top}Y
$$

<h3>The Seasonality Problem</h3>
How can we predict publisher revenue based on patterns in behavior over time?<br></br>
For example, do people tend to buy more on Fridays versus Mondays?<br></br>
In the morning versus night?

<h3>The Seasonality Model</h3>
using a simple regression,<br></br>
we want to generate the revenue $y$ based on selected input signals $x_1 ... x_j$.<br></br>
these are all indicator variables that take on the value 0 | 1 (a.k.a. booleans).

<h3>Example: Weekday Seasonality</h3>
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_3 + \beta_4x_4 + \beta_5x_5 + \beta_6x_6	$$
y is the publisher revenue<br></br>
$x_1$...$x_6$ are the variables Monday through Saturday (either 0 or 1 depending on 
what day of the week it is; Sunday is the intercept)<br></br>
$\beta_0$...$\beta_6$ are the <i>average</i> values of the revenue on Sunday-Monday, respectively. <br></br>
This is what we are trying to find. 

<h3>Example, con't</h3>
Let's say we only have one week's worth of data.<br></br>
Then,<br></br>
$$x = \begin{bmatrix}Sunday\\Monday\\Monday\\Tuesday\\Tuesday\\Tuesday\\Wednesday\\Thursday\\Friday\\Friday\\Saturday\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$

$$y = \begin{bmatrix} $_{Sun} \\ $_{Mon} \\ \ $_{Mon} \\ $_{Tues} \\ $_{Tues} \\ $_{Tues} \\$_{Weds} \\ $_{Thurs} \\ $_{Fri} \\ $_{Fri} \\ $_{Sat} \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 0.0 \\ 0.5 \\ 0.5 \\1.0 \\ 1.5 \\ 1.5 \\ 0.0 \\ 0.5 \\ 1.0 \\ 0.5 \\ 1.0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

The repetition of days means that several transactions occurred on that day.
This is a simplified example: In reality, there would be many, many values per day, of course!<br></br>

<i>Note: I just made up some y-values to demonstrate</i>

<h3>Con't... </h3>
$$\beta = (X^{\top}X)^{-1}X^{\top}Y$$ so
$$\beta = \begin{bmatrix} \beta_{Sun} \\ \beta_{Mon} \\ \beta_{Tues}  \\ \beta_{Weds} \\ \beta_{Thurs} \\ \beta_{Fri} \\ \beta_{Sat} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 0.00 \\ 0.50 \\ 1.33 \\ 0.00 \\ 0.50 \\ 0.75 \\ 1.00 \end{bmatrix} $$

Which is indeed the average revenue per ad call on a given day!

<h3>Downweighting</h3>
But what if we had two or more weeks of data?
We want the value of $\beta$ to be <i>cumulative</i>, but don't want the data from 6 months ago to be worth the same as yesterday's data! <br></br>
Data that is more recent is likely to be a better predictor for the revenue.

<h3>Con't...</h3>
introduce the variable $\gamma$ to <i>downweight</i> older data. <br></br>
Let's say we had $n$ weeks of data. Then, we'll multiply the $i^{th}$ week's data by $\gamma^{i-n}$, 
where i = 1, 2, ..., n. <br></br>
That means the most recent data has downweight $\gamma^0$, or no downweighting at all, 
whereas the first week will be downweighted by a multiple of $\gamma^{n-1}$, yielding a much smaller product. <br></br>
This means, of course, that $\gamma \le 1$, or else we'd get bigger and bigger values the farther we went back in time! <br></br>

<h3>Cumulative Beta Example</h3>
Let's say, for example, we have 3 weeks of data, and we set $\gamma = 0.5$ (in other words, each week is worth half as much the further back you go in time). <br></br>
Then, we have: <br></br>
At the end of the first week, $\beta = (X_1^{\top}X_1)^{-1}(X_1^{\top}Y_1)$<br></br>
At the end of the second week, $\beta = (0.5*X_1^{\top}X_1 + X_2^{\top}X_2)^{-1}(0.5*X_1^{\top}Y_1 + X_2^{\top}Y_2)$<br></br>
At the end of the third week, $\beta = (0.25*X_1^{\top}X_1 + 0.5*X_2^{\top}X_2 + X_3^{\top}X_3)^{-1}(0.25*X_1^{\top}Y_1 + 0.5*X_2^{\top}Y_2 + X_3^{\top}Y_2)$

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was a little girl I had two main (American-as-apple-pie) agendas on my wish list: one, to be the proud owner of an American Girl doll, and two, to join the Girl Scout Brownie troup. My mother was a steadfast soldier against both fronts, no matter how much a begged and pleaded and whined, flipping the pages of the beloved catalog and circling favorite items until the staples wore off. 

In retrospect, the anti-doll campaign was a pragmatic choice: the overly commercialized dolls were not only pricey, but had a tendency to lead to a sort of give-a-mouse-a-cookie effect (if i had the overpriced doll, surely I would need the overpriced little doll bed to match, and if I had the bed, certainly I would need a matching miniature quilt, and so on…), but I never did find out why she was so anti-Brownies. Maybe it was too establishment for her? Perhaps she was creeped out by religious undertones? Was it a health thing, as everyone knows Cookies are a Sometimes Food™ and selling gallons of Thin Mints would naturally lead to gallons of Thin Mint consumption (those motherf***** are addicting!)? I forgot to ask, and in any case the Girl Scouts have not been on my radar in many, many years. That is, until I saw <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/opinion/scoutings-gay-founder.html"> this article </a> in the nytimes that made me do a double take. And boy, am I glad that I never did get to wear that brown vest now.

The fact that the Boy Scouts actively discriminates against homosexuals is absurd. Scouting was popularized to be a healthy way for young boys to bond over outdoor and athletic activities that strengthened not only muscles but morals. Actively excluding a segment of the human population doesn't seem like good ethical standards to me. For Pete's sake, the founder might have actually been a closest queen!

Supporters have cited many "reasons" for the continued exclusion of gays, most of which you can read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/19/why-do-the-boy-scouts-exclude-gays"> here </a> (including the official statement by the Boy Scouts). One of the arguments is that sexuality has no place in the program, which is mostly catered for youngsters under twelve. In that case, why the need to discriminate, which, ironically, will be a surefire way to <em>ensure</em> that sex is now on the agenda?

I am fortunate to have grown up in mostly liberal environments and now reside in one of (if not the foremost) LGBT-friendly cities in the world. If I sat down and did a head count, I think I might actually have an equal number of straight and gay/lesbian/bisexual friends in my circle of closest acquaintances. I understand that not everyone is that lucky to be able to say the same, and what seems like common sense to me may be viewed as radical to others. But I am pretty sure that it <em>is</em> universally acknowledged that discrimination is hurtful. Even the littlest of Cub Scouts can vouch to that.

I realize that politics is complicated and that the Church provides much of the funding for the Boy Scout programs, but frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. Last September, the military finally admitted that its "Don't ask, Don't Tell" policy was serving no one and abolished it to cheers worldwide. Do we really need to repeat this discussion again, full of harmful stereotypes, in the ears of the children?]]></content:encoded>

I'm in line with his theory, although, like <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/thoughts-on-online-learning-and-the-value-of-a-college-degree/">I stated the other day</a>, professors and institutions leave much to be desired in improving the quality of higher education.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past Wednesday, in the last of the amazing speaker hackNY guest lecture series, we had the lucky opportunity to listen to team of partners at <a href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a>, composed of many of the biggest names in venture capital on the East (and West) coast. As we progressed through the Q&amp;A session, complemented by a spectular, shimmering view of the setting sun over the Manhattan skyline, someone brought up the inivetible (and important) concern of whether this new start-up acropolis of Manhattan would make it. That is, beyond the hype and the parties and the geek-chic hipster glasses, would this bloom-and-burst of web apps amount to any valueable ecosystem?

Someone answered, and I forget who, that it was <em>exactly</em> these little failures, these short-lived spurts, that <em>lead</em> to a strong and stable economy. He compared it to <a href="http://blog.chaddickerson.com/">Chad Dickerso</a>n, CEO of <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> (also an amazing speaker that we got the chance to listen to on Monday, and head of a company that I have had a huge crush on for years now)'s technical dogma of continuous deployment. At Etsy, engineers are required to continuously deploy-- in other words, push out new code as quickly as possible-- even if that code may not be perfected yet. The code is <em>expected</em> to be flawed and eyes and ears are kept alert to catch and patch up any holes. The argument, which at first appears counter-intuitive, is that this methodology actually leads to a <em>more</em> reliable product, especially for something on the scale of Etsy.

<!--more-->

His words really struck a deep chord inside of me, I guess because the ideas of rapid development and taking risks are themes that come up again and again in the start-up world (as my roommate says, "Make shit break shit"), and sometimes I don't know if it is a mantra that I'd live by. It sounds rather wasteful and reckless. I guess I'm still a bit shook up by the old mantra of "too big to fail", but is "too small to fail" just as bad?

On the other hand, I can't agree more with the importance of failure, on both a personal and professional level. Failure is essential to life, it is essential to business, and it is essential to being a human being. Lots of times, I hear about these 20-something year-old guys making it big in Silicon Valley, but I'm more interested in hearing about the innovations they make to float to the top once they've been kicked down.


You may be wondering what right this little Ivy-League girl from small-town Suburbia has to speak of failure, but for many years, it was a steady companion in my life. From the ages of 5 to 15 I dedicated a huge part of my life to rhythmic gymnastics, a Eastern European hybrid of ballet and circus acrobatics, at my peak training more than 20 hours a week. Because school came relatively easily to me, and I like challenges, I considered gymnastics my true career.

The thing was, I wasn't a particularly <em>good</em> gymnast. I did fairly well when I was young (I think I placed 3rd in the state a long time ago), but I just wasn't cut out for it beyond the junior level. I lacked the bitchiness, the guts, and the hand-eye coordination to succeed. Also, I wasn't nearly thin enough or blonde enough, and I was <em>really</em> not Russian. Combine shaky nerves with one really <em>verbal</em> coach who was constantly calling us fat, stupid, ugly and so very <em>American</em> like it was the dirtiest word, and believe you me: when I say I failed, I failed <em>spectacularly</em>. Every competition, I screwed up in more creative ways than you can imagine, on moves I perfected during practice. 8 times out of 10 (I mean, I wasn't <em>that</em> bad), I would make a fool of myself, my coach would give me a death stare, and then I'd go to the bathroom and slap on another sparkly half-nude leotard and feel like shit.

I understand that it wasn't anywhere equivalent to going bankrupt or anything, but I did consider gymnastics my career and it was in many ways my professional life outside of school.

So, in short, a very long tangent to back up a very concise statement: failure does a person good. It makes them humble, sometimes it makes them cynical, but it always makes them a little (or a lot) wiser. I'm not encouraging you to all send your children to training camp now, because I think that self-esteem is important, but still, learn to fail and more importantly, learn to <em>get over it</em>. Never, ever, be too big to fail because, I guarantee, we are all quite small. Just like it can make a steady-state of economy, little failures build a steadier mind.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During lunch break I came upon <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/more-on-milk/">this</a> article by one of favorite chefs <a href="http://markbittman.com/">Mark Bittman</a>, which is actually a follow up to his original article, <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/got-milk-you-dont-need-it/"> Got Milk? You Don't Need It</a>. Basically, Bittman talks about how we don't really need to drink milk or eat dairy, which can actually cause many health problems in adults, but it's become a staple due to aggressive marketing, the Big Dairy Industry, the Government, etc. etc.

Note that I said Mark Bittman was one of my favorite <em>chefs</em> and not writers, because unlike his remarkably simple, clear and delicious recipes, I feel that he could execute his words with a bit more tact. Bittman is known for being a pioneer in food activism, and I am in fact a big supporter with many (if not all) of the causes he champions, which are really integral to making Americans more aware of their detrimental consumptions. I'm definitely of his no-milk stance, as I've never really enjoyed drinking milk either, and have found it to cause me stomach upset. (Now, ice cream, that's a different story. Total addict!)

But it's really hard for me to stomach (ha ha) any writing that uses personal anectodes to prove a potentially scientific point, which dairy intolerance most certainly is. Writing something as such will only lead to dozens (in this case, literally thousands!) of comments from psuedo-experts, quack doctors, crotchety old men/women who grew up with the slogan 3-a-day, etc. I'm not about to go all stubborn scientist on you, but look, as someone who studies Computer Science in an Engineering school maybe (just maybe) I'm a little bit of a hard-science snob with a capital S.

All in all, though, I'm not really too miffed, since I do like Bittman's food, and I definitely think this blind American reverence of dairy as some kind of wholesome food of the gods can't be so hot. And hey, if the goal was reverse-psychology, it's definitely done it's trick: nothing like a good dose of pseudo-science to get me all riled up and spreading the word. Such a potentially strong statement definitely deserves some thorough research.

Random nerd rant of the day:
What's the deal with HTML and whitespace? It always bothers me to no end that the assignment operator (=) is stuck right next to the variable, like &lt;div id="value"&gt;. (Why not div id = "value"?).  I'm no expert of HTML style &amp; syntax but it seems to be the norm. (And, for good measure, <a href="http://churchm.ag/if-programming-languages-were-essays-comic/">a little comic</a> that's semi-related).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>obligatory angry feminist rant on Suzanne Venker </title>
		<link>http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/obligatory-angry-feminist-rant-on-suzanne-venker/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Suzanne Venker wants us to surrender to our "nature", our femininity, so that "marriageable men will come out of the woodwork".

I ask: Why use the word surrender? And what the hell are we going to do with all these men waiting on hand and knee to marry us anyway? 

Oh, how I wanted to avoid reading her article, "<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/11/24/war-on-men/">the war on men</a>", on fox *cough cough cough* news. Why ruin a lovely Saturday morning? But since it was only about a page long, and I have a very short attention span for these sorts of nonsense, read it I did.

I don't have the time nor fuse to do a thorough reading and analysis of the piece. Nor do I wish to research the author more thoroughly. As such, I will simply give my reaction to a few select quotes. You may form your own opinions and arguments as you please. Me, I have better things to do. 

<i>Note: the best way to read the following is to insert an explecitive of your choice before every noun. Since this a relatively family/work-friendly blog, I left it out, but feel free to be creative. </i>

"Women aren’t women anymore."

Excuse me, I'm pretty sure as long as we have the correct body parts which we may do with as we please and/or identify as female, that is woman enough for me.

"All the articles and books (and television programs, for that matter) put women front and center, while men and children sit in the back seat." 

Uh, no. This is just plain incorrect. The percentage of female lead characters (and I mean lead characters, not femme fatales, objects of attraction, love interests) is still relatively small. The percentage of <i>strong</i> female leads, even less.

"Feminism serves men very well: they can have sex at hello and even live with their girlfriends with no responsibilities whatsoever."

To make the assumption that men are driven by their d*cks you might as well assume women are driven by their uteruses. Oh wait...

"Not only are they saddled with the consequences of sex, by dismissing male nature they’re forever seeking a balanced life."

Thanks for saddling us with the consequences of sex. I hope you never saddle anything else of mine.
 
"Men haven’t changed much – they had no revolution that demanded it – but women have changed dramatically."

Then perhaps it is time for men to undergo some change: learn to appreciate women who are career driven, independent, and maybe someone you can actually have a intelligent conversation with? And perhaps someone who can actually be your partner and equal? 

"In a nutshell, women are angry. They’re also defensive, though often unknowingly. That’s because they’ve been raised to think of men as the enemy."

This quote is the one that gets me the most. DO I SEEM ANGRY TO YOU?! 

In all seriousness-- maybe women are angry for good reason: maybe anger, like pain, is a necessary evil-- because it keeps us driven, and points to the fact that there are <i>real, concrete</i> issues out there to be angry about. 

If women are angry, I hope we stay angry until there is no more to be angry about. Better to be angry and passionate for change and justice than passive and content to settle. 

And just for the record, I can be damn feminine when I want to. Maybe I just have other priorities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I wanted to bring a little attention to <a href="http://deadspin.com/5931101/how-a-career-ends-dominique-moceanu-americas-youngest-gold+medal-gymnast">an article that recently caught my eye</a>. It's a piece based off an interview with Dominique Moceanu, the youngest American, at age 14, to win an Olympic gold medal in gymnastics. The article is part of a series, "Tell Me When It's Over", in which former athletes speak about the moment in which they realized their careers were finished.

Moceanu does not mince any words. I am not sure when the interview was conducted, but there is something almost child-like and innocent in how straightforward she is in relaying the alterior motives and politics in which her pure love of the sport was inevitbly intertwined. "[I]t was never the competition that frightened me", Moceanu recalls. "The hard part is the self-serving adults who wanted to use me as a means to an end". She then recounts how she was constantly belittled and abused after being taken under the wings of the world-famous Karolyis at the age of ten. The road to her Olympic gold was by no means easy, and even after victory there were no signs of gratitude from her coaches.

Accompanying the writing is a photograph of Moceanu at fourteen. Her leotard is white and her cheeks are still round with the slightest hint of baby fat. I long to reach out and give her a hug, even though I know that in real life she is near thirty now, because I know how it is. I think that anyone who was ever deeply and emotionally involved with a sport--especially one that relies on images of perfecition and beauty-- has a lens into a whole different rabbit hole.

I'll never know exactly what it is that motivates some coaches to act in this way.* Maybe it's tradition: the Russian Way, or the Bulgarian Way, or the Chinese Way is the way your ancestors did it, it's the way sponsored by the government, and it's the only way. Or perhaps the reasoning is empirical: harassing and hammering perfection into children is surely one way to make them obey. It doesn't work on everyone, for sure, especially those with weak nerves, but for some, it ignites a cold and dangerous fire inside. I don't think these men and women view what they do as wrong, for they are focused on creating champions, not well-balanced and stable human beings. Coaches are mysterious and private people, and the more vicious and crazy and flawed they are, the harder it is to hate them. Maybe that's the tactic all along.

Without rambling too much, I encourage you all to read Moceanu's "exit interview". Her thoughts add an important level of humanity and gravity to the games we all love and know and cheer for. It is easy to be caught up in the glamour and the gallantry of the Games. Even for a hardcore cynic and ex-gymnast like myself, watching the "Fierce Five" blew my mind away with the beauty of the sport and brought a glow to my heart for these girls, who seemed so very tiny and earnest. But when those Russian gymansts cried big fat tears all over television for their silver medal, there must have been a little more than just dissapointment going on.

The Olympics is a shiny, sparkly time in which we all hold hands and play good ole' sports and feel proud of our nations in a squeaky-clean way (aside from the occasional Chinese doping incident). Our athletes make us proud because they are so single-minded and incessantly loyal in their pursuits. There is no need for brain twisting or overthinking because there are no games. The goal is physical and explicit: all we have to do is sit back, knock down a few beers, and shout for U.S.A. It is important to remember, however, that no pursuit so grand can ever remain unadulterated, and that any lifestyle based on the sole image of perfection is ulitmately unsustainable.

<em>*Edit: I also strongly recommend reading Karolyi's "autobiography", <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feel-No-Fear-Politics-Gymnastics/dp/0786880201/ref=la_B001HN12P6_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344012002&amp;sr=1-1">Feel No Fear</a>. Still not sure how that man works but it provides the opposite perspective in a colorful way.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I started reading Kurt Vonnegut today. Slaughterhouse Five, anyone familiar? Never read any Vonnegut before, but I bought it off this guy who sells books on a cart for a dollar or five in front of NYU Stern business school. When I bought it off him I did not notice but apparently my friend said the week before his wrists were bandaged as if they had been slashed.

What a voice this Vonnegut has. I am only on the seventh page so I do not know for sure yet but I think he writes about war. His syntax reminds me of Joseph Heller's.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now here I was, sitting at home on a lazy summer's day, full of food and sleep, reading through the NYTimes to find something good and juicy to write about, and thinking maybe, just maybe, that actually none of the articles annoyed me today.

Then aforementioned now ex-roommate Jennifer comes to the rescue (as usual!) with a link to this <a href="http://140stitches.com/2012/8/2/nerds-its-time-to-up-your-fashion-game">appalling post</a>. And I smack myself in the forehead now for forgetting: Silicon Valley's like a gold mine of Sophie-rant material. Put together 99 parts men, one part opinionated woman, and an extremely distorted and sensationalist media, and you have one big recipe for trouble.

Anyway. Apparently <a href="http://www.140stitches.com/">140 Stiches</a> is "dedicated to all you tech nerds who have far more important things to do than care about what the hell you're going to wear. You were gifted in many ways - fashion sense not one of them. That's okay, because I have absolutely nothing better to do than tell you smart asses what to wear." Umm, OFFENSIVE, JUST A LITTLE?

But to cover-up right quick, the author makes sure to clarify that even though she just insulted the pants off your algorithm-loving asses, she's just one of "the boys". "If you think I'm just your average fashion obsessed girly girl, think again. I know my fair share about the interwebs and my favorite movie is The Social Network, in which I may or may not know every line."

Look guys, fashion sites are GREAT. Fashion advice is helpful and fun for those who WANT and need it. But making the bullheaded and unfortunate assumption that all nerds are men and unkept ones at that is not only offensive, it's, well, sexist. To both sexes!  I am a computer scientist and a nerd, but I also happen to be a fashionable metropolitan woman. And I also happen to like my algorithm-writing, bespectacled companions in their hackathon shirts. At least it shows a preference for intelligence over vanity, which not many people these days seem to have.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To-day in yoga class the girl next to me had a very large and slightly unseemly tattoo on her ankle of a phrase both succinct and wise: What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Who You Are.

This statement struck a deep and harmonious chord inside of me, because I think we are told far too often that What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger, which I feel is a cheap way of sugar-coating hardship and ignoring it for face value. While a lot of times what doesn't kill us does indeed strengthen us, if not physically, then at least in some mental way, it would be a blanket statement to hold this as a universal maxim. Sometimes what doesn't kill us really does weaken us. Sometimes it cripples us, sometimes it blinds us, and sometimes it even breaks us.

To learn and grow from trying times is not necessarily the direct function of the difficulty itself. While there definitely benefit in thinking positive, let's not confuse cause with correlation.

But what doesn't kill us most certainly molds us into who we are, unto death, for better, or for worse.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[phew! it's been a crazy, epic, sleepless week in the City. I can't believe that my summer internship is over and I'm no longer living with all the hackNY fellows. I just got back to the 'burbs yesterday and already I miss the energy. I miss working, and I miss my friends. NYC has made me a city girl through and through. And even though I know I have much left to learn, the thought of going back to school makes me feel uncomfortable. I like being a working woman. I like being part of a team, and I like getting stuff done.

Anyway, enough nostalgia: here's a video of the hackNY 2012 Demofest if you missed it live! My work begins at around 37:00. Definitely needed more rehearsal but  I hope you enjoy!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend I spent a crazy, sleepless 24 hours at Facebook NYC HQ's inaugural hackathon.

For those not in the field, hackathons are basically really condennsed, usually 24-hour tech competitions in which a big group of programmers (and sometimes designers) get together, form teams and try to make a usable, cool project. For anyone who's ever coded before, it's easy to see how insane of a deadline that is, hence lots of caffeine, little sleep, and really tired eyes. For everyone else, this concept sounds basically like insane torture. I used to think that too (you can read a little about it <a href="http://hackny.org/a/2012/06/on-hack-n-jill-and-changing-the-ratio/">here in this post I wrote for hackNY</a>), but they are actually fun! Really.

Anyway, the hackathon kicked off as usual with a little self-promo blurb from Facebook, then a little brainstorming pep talk (since, ideally, you are supposed to come up with the concept during the competition, too, like Iron Chef (basically the best cooking show ever but only the original Japanese version with voice dubbing)). To lead off the ideas, the emcee posed a typical hackathon prompt: what problems in your life are there that you'd like to solve?

I never realized until yesterday, when my crazy genius/totally awesome rooomate brought it to my attention, what a problematic question that is, not only for hackathons, but with respect to Silicon Valley/web 2.0 startups in general. Most of the participants in web 2.0 startups are fairly privileged: there may be some self-made men and women, high school dropouts and the like, but the majority do tend to stem from elite private schools, because, let's face it: when a small company needs to hire good developers fast without the luxury for deliberation, brand matters.

There's nothing wrong with solving "first world problems", building social networking sites, or making mobile games. I believe that all of the above are great excercises of human creativity and can lead to good, just on a different plane. However, it's important for all these talented and hardworking developers to realize that perhaps it's time to shift the focus away from introspection. Startups are filled with brilliant, bold employees who are out to change the world. Perhaps it's time to look beyond the first world.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi all,

I will be in Berlin and Paris for 10 days starting tomorrow, armed with one sturdy little backpack, an iphone, a notebook, Nietzsche's <em>Human, all too Human</em>, and a pair of walking shoes. If I have a spare moment perhaps I will attempt to punch out something on the tiny little iPhone touchpad. If not, peace till then!

À bientôt,

		<title>A Call for Tech-Savvy Politicians</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Thursday in unprecidented hacker news (not to be confused with <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>) Barack Obama, Mr. President himself, signed on social site/geeky fave <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> for an "Ask Me Anything Session" in which he answered <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/obamas-reddit-ama-the-full-questions-and-answers/261756/">ten questions</a> submitted by users. While to most of the citizens of the US this probably meant little (Reddit is notoriously niche-y and not particularly visually appealing to those unfamiliar with the structure), it was, in many ways, a big virtual step for both the Internet and American politics. We have officially entered an age in which the two can no longer exist ignorant of one another.

Aside from Al Gore inventing the <a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp">internet</a>, most politicians continue to shy away from bringing the web and its implications into the foreground of the political circus. This may be due, in part, to either fear or ignorance: after all, most statesmen are at least in the generation of my parents, and if anyone's ever seen <a href="http://whenparentstext.com/">a text from my mom</a>, we all know how much fun that can be.

But in an age when even Grandma's on Facebook and, more gravely, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2012/03/internet-middle-east"> revolutions can be fought on and sparked by the web</a>, we can no longer afford to dismiss the internet as merely a teenager's toy or nerd's paradise. More and more heavily accessible and addictive web and mobile applications are turning towards social features. With nary a law to protect the rights of the virtual citizen, there's no standard and no way to prevent our data from being abused, or at the very least, used in exceedingly creepy ways.

Last year the internet was set aflame over debates on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA">SOPA/PIPA Acts</a>, and it was a scary moment of realization for those who grew up with the freedom and creativity of the free web. Yes, pirating is bad, but without a good understanding of our online rights, how can we know how much new laws will undermine expression?

The Internet remains one of the last hints of wilderness in the West. Left alone, like all true wild and beautiful places, sooner or later boots will tramp down, trees will be felled, and fences put up. We need to urge politicians to STUDY and SUPPORT the creativity and rights of the online world, but they are only so many figureheads. Without an awareness of the significance of our individual online presences, no positive change can occur.

Obama's venture into the Reddit community was a small symbolic step in the right direction, but now we need real concrete policies to follow . As the 2014 elections come up, it's a good time to consider not only one's rights as a U.S. citizen, but a virtual one too.

<em>Fun fact: I had the great opportunity of hearing founder Alexis Ohanian speak to hackNY over the summer. Really charismatic and smart guy, and an impressive activist.</em>

<em></em><em>Less fun fact: I actually don't go on Reddit myself, living up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Demographics">its demographics of 72% male</a>. But that's another story for another day.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is there shame in being an introspective creature?  </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This, to me, is the good life: a strong latte. a book. a pen and some paper. a text editor to write in, and an idea to write of. some code to tinker with. (free wifi.)

Don't get me wrong, I very much like being thrown into the chaos of the material world. I love working on teams and the fast pace of start-ups. There are times I yearn to put on a business suit and heels and lead high-powered debates and discussions. I <i>like</i> working, with all of its politics and frustrations and setbacks. I'm an engineer, and I like making things. But at the end of the day, undeniably, it is designing the models, not building them, that I prefer. 

In the US, I think, there is a huge emphasis on big material accomplishments. We want our most hopeful children to become leaders, and we want to see them move, create, and break things. This, however, is neither suited to nor approved of by everyone. Yet, there is the Machiavellian assumption that it is in fact <i>the most noble</i> and right to sacrifice one's own self-cultivation to worldy action. Pursuing the Platonic "good life" is tinged with guilt and the malodorus scent of elitism.    

Is there shame, in this society, in being an introspective creature? And, if we think so, is a product of Western culture only, or is it so universal that it must be imperative? Is there shame for those who'd rather Think Big than Make Big? Is it selfish and cowardly, or perhaps noble?

This tangent popped into my head on my flight on the way to Paris, which, most definitely, holds a kind of cultural expectation far different from our own. I was sipping some white wine I had gotten <i>gratis</i> (I can't emphasize it enough...FLY EUROPEAN AIRLINES!) and flipping through some magazine I had picked up at the airport, the French version of the sort of publication I secretly (or not so secretly) really enjoy, along the lines of Glamour, or Elle, or some other probably sexist crap that's filled with really entertaining probably idiotic love advice, when I happened upon an article with the title "Travailler Moins Pour Vivre Plus!" (work less to live more). We often joke about the French being selfish and self-absorbed (my mom, who went to University in Paris, jokingly said of this to me, "l'enfer, c'est les autres"), but is it maybe self-protection, and if self-protection, is that really selfish in the long run?

In any case, it is worth thinking about. I do not in any way have a definitive answer nor opinion yet on this thought, but I will leave you with a quote that is inscribed on the Berlin wall in the East Side Gallery, which, by the way, is absolutley gorgeous:

"Viele kleine Leute an vielen kleinen Orte, die viele kleine Schritte tun, können das Gesicht der Welt verändern.” 

<i>“Many small people in many small places, who do many small steps, can change the face of the world.”</i>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sophie! Enjoyed your thoughts. Please tell me that you've buried into Ayn Rand before; she was a huge proponent of selfishness as a sustainable value system, and you'd probably enjoy reading her work (or, at least, find it interesting.)

I was wondering though, is "introspective" what you meant, or is something more like "self-oriented" (or maybe something with a less abrasive connotation, like "self-focused" ) more fitting? It quickly went from Plato and hedonism to introversion, and I wasn't sure if that connection was intentional.

I liked the last quote, though; reminds me of an African proverb I really like:

"If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

(Also: "travelling" as a tag? Did british spelling conventions slip into your subconscious of something? :p)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi John!
Thanks for the nice long comment.
I've actually not read much Rand before, just the usual high school required. I remember not really liking her back then, but perhaps I should pick it up again.


On the use of words:
I will admit freely that sometimes I just like certain words and abuse them a bit. Most of my blog posts are written as a stream of thought with no edits/drafts in half an hour or so, and I tend to write by feel and style rather than cohesion. Which can be, if not edited, problematic. However i'd rather write something flawed for now if it feels more organic since I want blogging to stay a hobby for me.


On the extreme connections:
Hmm. I guess you could say it was intentional, because those were all concepts that came to me in the past few days, and I felt like they all needed to be touched upon. Should definitely have done it more gracefully though!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like the stream of consciousness! It feels more heartfelt and personal. I was just wondering if you really intended on saying self-reflection, Thinking Big, and self-indulgence were interchangeable -- which is an interesting idea, but it's one I'm not sure I can agree with yet. I understand these weren't finalized thoughts, though; if you decide ponder it more in the future, blog it up yo! :D]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Musings on a haircut</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I got a short haircut for the first time in my life, chopping off nearly a foot and a half of hair.

This decision, like most of my most drastic ones, was made spontaneously without much reasoning. Ironically, I tend to spend hours on hours hemming and hawing over tiny nuances of the heart and mind yet act rashly and boldly on all else. One day, I woke up, and simply <em>needed</em> to cut it all off. I couldn't even wait for an appointment-- I made my mother hack at it with kitchen scissors. Snip, snip, snip: and months and years of long brown locks fell into the garbage.

How interesting it is that we as humans have this special ability to transform and redefine ourselves with a mere reshaping of cells already dead. A lion doesn't wake up and think, <em>maybe it's time to grow out my 'fro</em>. There are long-haired cats and short-haired cats and they are born that way and remain for life. Usually one species has the same coverage, or, at most, one variation for the female and one for the male, and perhaps a protective camoflauge for the young. But here we go in the most human way, imposing all sorts of rules: short for men, long for women; gingers are sassy, frizzy hair unruly, blonde hair dumb, brunettes boring.

Of course, since it's <em>me</em>, the implications that stand out the most are the gender ones. Last week, one of my friends and mentor showed me off her new pixie style, joking that this was her "dyke haircut", and when I asked another about her opinion on my short hair, she replied that I was "feminine enough to pull it off". The first thing my friends asked me when they saw me was whether or not I felt "so much freer". The physical answer is not really-- short hair sits surprisingly heavily on the back of ones neck and it's a hassle not to be able to sweep it up into a big ballerina bun. They are, of course, mostly talking about the mental implications-- and that makes ponder the true state of women's liberation, if even in the era of iphones we still stop ourselves to fuss about a hairdo.

I feel less pretty with short hair and maybe that's a good thing. Some dresses and shirts don't look as cute anymore and so I've simply stopped decorating myself for them. I have this theory that for every inch of hair you cut off, you have to make up for it with an inch of personality and I wonder if that's true. I guess I have still quite a few feet to grow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Coursera, an online learning company founded by two Stanford scientists, announced its plans to expand and include additional major research universities. Naturally,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/education/consortium-of-colleges-takes-online-education-to-new-level.html"> this article</a>  drew a slew of comments, reigning from praise to outright condemnation.</p>
<p>Since I am a very impatient person with a natural distaste for politics (who also believes that any newspaper article that has more than one page could be condensed and rewritten), I'm not going to attempt to make some highfalutin, well-constructed argument for or against online education. Instead, I'm just going to give my general feelings towards this debate, formed from my experience (paying thousands upon thousands of dollars) at an Ivy-League institution (institution also being one of my least favorite words in the English language).</p>
<p>Here's my two cents:<br />
I am a big fan of open-source anything (the Hacker in me) and the idea of making education more transparent and accessible is wonderful, especially if that means we can narrow the education/socio-economic gap and help dissipate the notion of academics as a privilege for the elite.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the discussion surrounding Coursera and online courses seems to point to a big question mark: what is the point of pouring one's life savings into education when, theoretically, you could get "the milk for free"?</p>
<p>The answer in my mind is, in theory, clear: the money put into schooling is never, ever simply for the lecture notes, but more than anything, the human interactions that one makes. Having the Powerpoints of a Noble Prize-winning professor is no where near the same as going to his/her office hours or even hearing his/her voice live and being able to ask questions. Online education is great for gaining technical skills and a godsend for those short on resources, but it can never replace the value of human contact. Of course an Ivy-League education is worth the price tag: that alone, in addition to being surrounded by some of the most intelligent and motivated students in the world, is more than enough.</p>
<p>Yet I am not sure if I can wholeheartedly stand by the statement. My first semester at Columbia's Engineering school was miserable-- filled with huge introductory lectures taught by professors whose brilliance did not necessarily translate to teaching. The required introductory course for all first-year Engineers was both boring and disorganized and furthermore felt useless (what use was modeling gears in Auto-Cad to Chemical Engineering (my interest at the time), or Computer Science (what I do now)? ). I am fortunate to have found a field of study that I can genuinely say that I am passionate about, yet had it not been for a last minute decision to sign up for introductory Java, that may have never happened. Moreover, and more significantly, had the professor not been Adam Cannon, whose class is often considered one of Columbia's best, I may have found Computer Science to be just as tedious and uninteresting as I did Chemistry, which I feel is both unfair and untrue about the subject.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the discussion about Coursera will direct attention not only to the benefits of online learning, but more urgently, the flaws of the current state of tertiary education that we pay so much for, <em>especially</em> in the fields of science and engineering. The small discussion seminars constituting Columbia College's Liberal Arts "Core" are almost universally viewed by students as positive and community-building experiences. The two that I elected to take were genuinely thought-provoking and I feel have had a huge influence on my character. Why should a student who prefers science be subjected to years of lectures and problem sets? All students benefit from interactive environments. In fact, I argue that scientists are even <em>more</em> opinionated and vocal about their beliefs and interests. I think I'd rather be sentenced to hell in an eternal argument between a radical liberal and a Right-wing conservative than Emacs versus Vim.</p>
<p>To close the knowledge gap by raising the value of virtual education while lowering the quality of live teaching is a phenomenon that benefits no one. Online tools are a great innovation, and ought to be viewed as a challenge for traditional schooling to step up to its price tag, rather than a make-do substitute for the real thing.</p>

		<title>Much Ado About Being Nothing </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The following piece is a re-post from the <a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/">Columbia Daily Spectator</a>, where I am an opinion blogger. The original may be <a href="http://spectrum.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/much-ado-about-being-nothing">found here</a>.</em>

Today I came across <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/on-being-nothing/" target="_blank">an article</a> that I found particularly resonant, especially as the second week of classes rolls to an end with nothing left of home but crumbs in the bottom of mom's care package, and as we bid adieu to the last comforts of summer and surrender ourselves finally, familiarly, into the ebb and wave of this chaos that we call college.

The piece, titled "On Being Nothing", details a very personal account of the author's journey from being a cherished child in a small-town setting to a run-of-the-mill student on a big campus, a transition overwhelmed by anxiety bordering on existential.

It's a transition that rings familiar with any college student, but especially those at Columbia, where everyone is fiercely talented, fiercely independent, and often submerged in their own ends. Not to mention that the campus plays second fiddle to the background of the biggest, busiest city in the world.

I found the writing insightful and touching, elegantly depicting the difference between school and home with phrases like "Though I made friends, I no longer had an audience." Although, of course, many commenters felt otherwise, and this being the internet chose to say so, usually along the lines of "Oh grow up already. Get over yourself".

But that, my dear, would be missing the point. Similarly, yesterday's <a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2012/09/12/leaving-home">Canon</a> questions the degree to which we should separate ourselves from home during our time at Columbia. <a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2012/09/12/you-are-what-you-are">Junior Jake Goldwasser</a> responded by advocating to "detach ourselves from the familiar", keeping our families close but also learning to be isolated. On the battle between the collegiate's identity as a child and as "scholar/party-animal/athlete/rebel/addict/artist", he states that "[i]f the struggle has a winner, it is the new you".

It's a truth that I find obvious, and also understated. There really is no "old" or "new" you, just you, however you choose to define yourself. And an identity built solely on the affirmation of others, whether at home or at school, is no identity at all. Most of us at Columbia are used to applause from teachers and parents and coaches, and perhaps in adolescence chose to spend many hours in solitude in order to hone these lauded skills rather than building webs of cultivating relationships and support.

At the close of "On Being Nothing" the author encourages the reader to undergo "a Copernican revolution of the self", to "let go of our vanity and join the swirl of activity". It may not always be vanity (in fact often the very opposite) that causes us to seek the affirmation of others, but to constantly look up—for the reaction of one's boss, one's family, or one's community—will only cause blindness from the Sun.

		<title>Where I have Been and Other Things </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How ironic it is that 2 weeks ago I wrote an article on How Women Can't Have it All, when I was, in fact, on my way to breaking point.

These past 2 weeks have been hellish to say the least.

The workload at Columbia has always been tough but I never envisioned how brutal it would be taking 2 graduate level courses along with 3 other programming intensive classes. Perhaps there are some who can handle it, but I do not have the build for it...

As a disclaimer, I have never placed too much value in letter and number grades and so the stress was really purely situational and not the blame of perfectionism, etc.

On the other hand, I <em>am</em> am a bit of an academic "purist" and have always loved learning for learning's sake--thus placing a great emotional investment in what I study, especially towards Computer Science and Philosophy, which are my two main interests and have become part of my identity. And so perhaps that is even more of a burden than the pursuit of numbers, as it pains my soul not to learn what interests me well.

And identity, I realize, is integral to the issue. All my life I have been involved in very artistic and expressive pursuits, and so it has always been a secret fear in the back of my head after I started seriously dedicating my studies to the hard sciences I would lose part of myself. Close-minded stereotypes and assumptions of Engineering students I discovered existed after arriving to college did not help. So I imposed concrete, tangible markers on my self-- a minor in Philosophy, Writing for the Spectator-- to make sure someone, something else aside from me would be putting checks on my identity and keep it from slipping away to monotony.

On the one hand, dance (ballet classes and student groups), writing (for my blog and for the Spec) and philosophy (the Ethics class which I am taking, which I adore), have been saving graces in overwhelming times.

I remember one morning waking up so exhausted and sleep deprived that I had the terrifying revelation that <em>I could not get myself to feel anything at all</em>. I wandered through my morning in a stupor--unable to empathize with any human being. It was incredibly disorienting. The moment I finally regained my sense of humanity was when I walked into my ethic professor's office hours. In the sunny room, in the mahogany Philosophy Hall, we had a great conversation on normative ethics and I finally felt myself again.

But on the other side, I realize that I am stretching myself way too thin just to hold on to these societally imposed, arbitrary markers on myself. And so I have withdrawn from my position as a blogger at the Spec*, and have dropped my Philosophy minor, even though it pains me to do so. Health comes first, existence precedes identity (arguably). I can still grow as a writer on my own time, and read great works at my leisure, perhaps auditing courses as life permits.

Dimensionality comes foremost from dimensionality in <em>thought</em> and an open mind-- which can barely be achieved when it is overworked and undernourished.

I hope to keep these things in mind, as I learn to worry less about the labels I place on myself. Quality over quantity.

Thank you friends and family for being infinitely valuable.

Take care.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[first: congrats to President Obama on his second term! what a nerve-wracking and exciting election it was. in general i do not enjoy very much politics as it is, in my opinion, far too political and rarely efficient nor rational. the best thing about election years, in my opinion, is the discussion and debate it causes people to have with each other. although i generally vote democratic I have had a number of really great conversations with my peers: liberal, conservative, and independent. however, here's to hoping we do indeed move Forward with an open mind and real change.

no rant today, just a few things that have been on my radar lately and will hopefully get your brain a little extra food for thought on this rainy and frigid wednesday. and yes, i feel like writing in all lowercase today. interesting how the way words look on a page can have so much of an effect on one's voice. in general, i have a thing for ALL CAPS (certain works, in my ideal world, should always be written in CAPS, such as the words of KANT), however it's the first day back to school after a strange hurricane week, 4 days off from school, an exhilarating election, and i have a midterm tomorrow. so, undercaps (is that a thing?) it is.

recently read <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/meltdown">this article</a> written by an MIT student whose experience mirrors <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/where-i-have-been-and-other-things/">my own conflicted feelings</a> about attending a high-pressure high-cost university. no matter what college you may be studying at or not even in school at all, it is a very well-written, touching piece and a good thought-provoker. 

second, and more nerdy-fun thing: say what you may about Facebook's privacy policies/business interactions/Mark Zuckerberg, etc. etc. (I actually am not a huge fan but i am, as always, biased) but it is for sure one hell of an addicting product. and, being scientifically minded, i've always been fascinated by guessing the algorithms it uses to queue up one's friend list and other auto-complete actions. i spend a good deal of time guessing why it choses to show the friends it does on a certain profile, etc. etc. but maybe i'm just a nerd. 

ANYWAY, i found this very interesting JS bookmarklet and a great explanation of how it works on <a href="http://thekeesh.com/2011/08/who-does-facebook-think-you-are-searching-for/">this blog post</a>. in short, the bookmarklet will pop up a list of rankings based on how FB guesses what your order of searches will be. aka who does it think you stalk the most? potentially embarrassing, but certainly fun. the algorithm FB uses is called EdgeRank. google it for more fun distracting research!

		<title>how to make CS courses better</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I sit here working on a project in lieu of going to class for the umpteenth time, I realized with sudden clarity that perhaps the current way that Computer Science is taught in universities is not the optimal way. Large lecture halls, clunky languages-- it's a bad sign when even a die-hard "learning for learning's sake" student skips class on a regular basis. 

anyway, a few thoughts on how <i>I</i> would change the structure of Computer Science courses to maximize efficiency + interest and minimize pain:

STOP TEACHING JAVA.

Seriously. I have never, ever been required to interview in a specific language at any company (even the "big names"), and if the people you're talking to are deadset on Java, you probably don't want to work there anyway. C is a much, much better "lower" level language for really grasping the way programming works, and Python is a much, much more fun language if you want to lower the barriers to entry and get students making things right away.

MAKE GRADES ENTIRELY PROJECT BASED FOR NON-THEORETICAL CLASSES

For classes like data structures, advanced programming, OOP, etc., etc. students tend to learn a great deal more and invest much more time and interest in coding projects. These should be the heart of the course, and is what matters in "the real world", anyway. No one's going to give you a bonus for remembering the difference between inheritance and polymorphism: let's face it, you'd take the 5 seconds to Google the
 definitions and move on. Big projects, tight deadlines, collaboration: this is where the real learning is.

IF YOU MUST MAKE STUDENTS TAKE EXAMS, STOP ASKING LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC SYNTATICAL QUESTIONS

In my opinion, you should not administer written exams in technical classes (see above). However, if you must, for heaven's sake, please, please do not ask us things like the difference between strcmp and strncmp. Sometimes coding by hand with pencil and paper is good practice for interviews, but the code should be judged for logic and not syntax. Exams should be theory-based. Technical evaluations should be project-based. EOM.

IF YOU MUST HAVE LECTURE COURSES, PLEASE LIMIT THE SIZE OF THE CLASS

Size matters. This one is a given. Of course small seminars are best, but it's understandable that budget might not allow for it. Lectures for intro courses only, and please, please try to cap them: there is a huge difference in ambiance and quality of learning between a lecture of 50 and of 250. I'm talking to you, Columbia. When I'm in a room with 300 other students learning about the difference between * argv[] and ** argv I immediately want to fall asleep or eat.

THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF FOR NOW.

then again, it's entirely my fault for taking up class time to write in English instead of C++.           

<em>P.S.: Shout out to everyone in AP lecture who's on Facebook right now. Hello! Now I feel less guilty for skipping class. At least I'm "working" in the library.</em>

<em>P.P.S.: For the record, I do believe that Jae is a great professor and administers valid albeit perhaps too difficult exams. Personally, I enjoy tough exams (sink or swim time/everyone failed so I feel less bad for not studying). The main clincher here is a) the size of lecture (TOO BIG) and b) little grade weight on projects. Neither of these can really be blamed entirely on the professor, cough *administration* cough cough </em>

<em>P.P.P.S.: Yes, perhaps strcmp and strncmp + polymorphism are not the best examples, as esp. the polymorphism question is more theoretically important. But you get the gist of the idea. </em>

<em>P.P.P.P.S. It is probably true that if I took 10 minutes to edit my posts I would not have to use postscripts, but what's the fun in that? </em>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post.  I agree with alot of it.  I have a degree in Computer Science graduate and now I oversee four teams of .Net developers who code in C# and C++ on LInux.  We have a terrible time recruiting programmers so I am very invested in fixing the problem.  


Other than Android I rarely come across anyone who is using Java, however, Java is a great language for teaching object oriented programming;  C++ and PHP are not.  Ruby (on Rails) or C# would be better in my view but I understand why the edu community has embraced Java.  Moving from Java to C# is a snap. I don't think the language is the problem.  Either you like to code or you don't.


As for lectures and exams universities are attempting to teach critical thinking and the ability to analyze and solve problems.  I look a lot of EE classes and remember them being alot harder than the CS classes.  


I like the smaller class sizes and more labs - possibly decoupled from lectures but the theory stuff is important.  For example learning design patterns is critical.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The biggest problem for the head of IT is "too many programmers are heavily invested in language X and now language X is becoming obsolete and they can't bear it."  We need to teach students how to analyze any language and adapt to it rather than be an expert in that language.   Oddly enough this is the same issue in attempting to teach students how to be global citizens.  How do you teach people how to listen and learn, assessing the differences and similarities between this new culture and the one they grew up with, and then be able to adapt to the new culture?   Yes, we need expert Java folks and C folks, but then one day we don't need them anymore.  Do they (and we)  know what to do when that day comes?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm just about to graduate from Berkeley EECS, and almost every interview is done in a specific language, which could simply be a problem with the job type I am applying for.


Java might not be the best low level language or the best introductory language, but it is useful for a variety reasons. It's used so much in companies thanks to the JVM, so becoming familiar with it in school is helpful. It is strongly typed, which with an ide like eclipse makes writing code pretty easy. It's great for OOP, while also good for threading.

I agree with your exams point and your projects point. 

The class size is unavoidable as CS becomes more and more popular.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I (nearly) totally agree with you. Sure, you screwed up on examples but you still have a point. Inheritance and polymorphism are fundamentals.

Projects: Those are the things which make people learn.
I'm an autodidact (had already some years of experience prior to university) and it's quite shocking seeing courses in my country (italy, with lowercase initial). 
Most of the courses are math, done at varying degrees of difficulty.
The few courses which do have some resemblance of other countries CS courses are taught in the worst possible way. 
Professors in class talk about theoretic aspects, without giving any hint about how to actually do stuff. 
The projects are valued at 20-30% of an exam but are the biggest issues which make people lose years of university and money.
I'm talking about people with a 30/30 (it's a vote) who can't actually code the project.
After 3 years, most of the people still don't know how to write code. The few who are able to deliver something are those who worked in the past or those who spent a lot of extra time on their projects.

The people from other states of Europe which come here to study are shocked to see the absurd amount of theory we have to study and often fail exams (at least, I've had experience with only 3 abroad students). They said to do more practical stuff at home. 
The students I knew didn't get to an exam with a project (which are often blocked by 2 or 3 theoretical exams), but I had the chance to work with them on a personal project and they were much more prepared for work than italian students.

I've just one suggestion: don't hire italians, unless they have proven their experience (with opensource project or previous works).

University here is really fucked up and it's still suffering from being a branch of other courses.
Things are even worse with Engineering of Computer Science. Despite the name they have far less projects (a friend of mine which got into EoCS did only 1 project in 3 years, compared to the 7 we did at CS). People at EoCS usually fail because they can't grasp the advanced math theoretical courses (which are common to all the Engineering courses).

Java: I'm fucking sick of java propaganda at my university.
Seriously, I'd rather have political propaganda than those idiotic professors telling me that "performance doesn't count" or to use eclipse "because of all the awesome plugins which make everything easy".
That may be true, but and no, I will not code your stupid project in Java, because I like to have app which start immediately and because I'd like to have a GUI which doesn't suck on nearly every system!
Holy crap, there are a lot of awesome languages and build systems, I'd rather die than wait for Eclipse to load up or for using ant (which, btw, is pretty slow when compared to other build tools - I tried gradle on a fairly simple project and was amazed)
The worst thing is nearly everything they say is never tested by the students, because the projects are ridiculously small when compared to the matter.]]></wp:comment_content>

In theoretical courses like algorithms and data structures you can use your own pseudocode (if its understandable, I think your intepretation of whitespaces [1] will not count) if you have to explain it with code. The crowdest CS class was 
about 20 students in bachelor courses and about 12 students in the master courses. 

Maybe you should come to Germany to study CS. ;-)

It's one thing to look up syntactical constructs online - it's another thing to not understand common ideas.  I wouldn't hire a programmer that didn't understand inheritance or polymorphism and had to use google to figure it out.  That's unacceptable to me.  Googling the prototype for something like strncmp is totally okay - especially if the person doesn't write C every day.



I'll agree with you that exams should be theoretical and that teaching Java is horrible - but you absolutely have to understand core concepts without having to revert to google to figure it out.  Your code will suffer greatly if you don't.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>A Eulogy, of Sorts</title>
		<link>http://blog.sophiechou.com/2013/a-eulogy-of-sorts/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[this is a eulogy, of sorts. the first company that i had ever worked at, Omgpop, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/zynga-shuts-down-omgpop-one-year-after-acquiring-it-for-200m/">was recently shutdown by Zynga</a>. i would have written a response to it more quickly but a) i have been really worn out by my summer job (although learning a ton) and b) i was only there for 2 months as a college freshman 2 years ago, so i am, of course, not the closest person anymore to the once-startup.

if working for and supporting NYC startups for the past few years have taught me anything, it's that life is unstable, unpredictable, and not to be taken too seriously. things change, companies boom and burst and are bought and then dissapear; the next big thing is already yesterday's news by the time you download it, but the relationships you make in the office will last far beyond those confines.

i will be the first to admit i am not really a big consumer of internet games, or even mobile games aside from the occasional subway ride, but i was (remain) a wholehearted fan of Omgpop.

why?

because sometimes the love of the sport is created by the love for one's team; maybe they haven't made the playoffs but they're the reason you began to develop a liking towards the game in the first place. you don't need to be a gamer to realize the joy that a product made with care can bring, and the enthusiasm of a talented and determined team is beyond contagious. simply put, even though entertainment might not be thought of as serious stuff, it is in fact made very seriously, and with dedication and pride as any other product.

this is how, i, as a non-gamer intern, a freshman in college, with no major and no technical skills yet, was welcomed with open arms, introduced into the world of startups, met some folks who believed in me, was encouraged to study computer science, first heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackNY">a little program called hackNY</a>, and still think fondly towards every employee i met during my short stay.

from there, i dug deeper into coding, eventually landed that summer fellowship, where i was introduced to both machine learning and <a href="http://mathbabe.org/">mathbabe</a>, picked up my first (data) modelling skills, realized how much it excited me, changed my concentration to artificial intelligence, began my own writing blog, became part of the <a href="http://adicu.com/">ADI board</a>, discovered great community there, went to more hackathons, and eventually landed my current summer gig at <a href="http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a> on a team where i have the great gift of working directly with new and interesting data models of student learning, and am challenged everyday to be a better scientist.

tl;dr:
the route to developing one's career is not always straightforward when it is led by one's shifting interests and traversed through startups, but with great mentors and coworkers (who also become great friends), there is always the opportunity to learn and grow.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>In Other News Science Continues to be Sexist, No One is Shocked</title>
		<link>http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/in-other-news-science-continues-to-be-sexist-no-one-is-shocked/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Forgive me for the brevity, typos, and lack of filter: my brain has been wrapped around and fully defeated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning">Online Mistake-Bound Learning Models</a> and log base 2's and omega bounds and other uncomprehensible things in the last 48 hours.

Anyway, here's a nifty little article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/science/bias-persists-against-women-of-science-a-study-says.html">NYtimes</a> reporting a study about how not only were men likely to judge female students as less competent in the scientists, but <em>female</em> professors as well.

Does this really come as any surprise? Pretty sure that if 50% of the world tells you that you are scientifically less suited to a certain way of thinking, which is, by the way, entirely false, it doesn't take long for the other 50% to view these stereotypes as true. Too sleepy right now to expand on that but my mentor this summer aka <a href="www.mathbabe.org">Mathbabe</a> wrote a <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2012/02/06/women-in-math/">wonderful and far more thought-out piece</a> about the stereotype of women in math. Combine that with traditional concepts of femninity ("pushiness" is a turn-off, confidence is aggressive, to be scientific is to be cold) and you have a pretty surefire way to undermine confidence and perpetuate negative thinking.

Finally, two small anecdotes before I nap:

First, I was in a computer science program this summer with a male:female ratio of students of about 10:1 onsite, and I can tell you firsthand it is very hard to compete with the self-confidence of a 20-something white male, and ergo, very easy to be overcome by self-doubt, especially if you are timid. The entrepreneur is an especially cocky breed. Sorry, that was rude, I hope no one takes offense, and I do love you all. And I apologize for neither my apology nor my statement.

Second anecdote: I was in a study group last night with three other very intelligent, outgoing girls for aforementioned problem set, and somewhere around 2 am and the 10th proof in, the topic came to topic of female attractiveness w.r.t. men (because yes I am a normal college-age girl and not a robot). Anyway, it came as a suprise to me (or maybe not really a suprise) that it was heavily insisted upon that appearing "vunerable" was attractive. While I would probably agree that this is true, it made me slightly sad. Vunerability is of course what makes us human and lovable, but the idea that you might want to appear slightly weaker than you are in order to catch someone's eye or heart could be potentially dangerous. Deception, of course, is not admirable; yet trying to actually <em>be</em> weaker is more than frightening.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Male engineering grad here...

There are timid guys in those same classes, but I wonder if there's a difference in how timid guys and timid girls react to the presence of an cocky "alpha male" type. My perception is that girls in engineering classes are typically subjected to greater scrutiny by their peers, which may lead them to become a more extreme version of their natural personality: timid girls become meek and helpless, while outgoing girls become loud and "alpha female"-like. I'm not saying that every engineering girl is one of these two extremes ... just that it seems like the pressure of peer scrutiny can lead anyone to stop acting like themselves. Guys (in engineering) have the benefit of living outside the limelight if they want; it's really tough for girls to have that same privilege.


Hopefully none of that came across as sexist; I'm just trying to be open about my perceptions, prejudicial as they may be.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Ethan, 
I appreciate your insight. I agree: I've seen the same thing happen, even to myself, and I believe the reason lies in the problem of being under scrutiny that you've pointed out. Women in CS are rare and often cause confusion-- peers have a hard time categorizing us. As a defense mechanism, it is easy to become extreme versions of ourselves in order to make it more simple. This is, of course, unhealthy, and problematic.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sophie,
Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the program? How would you have preferred the male students to act? How would you have preferred the female students to act? Essentially, what can we do better?
(feel free to answer off-line and I promise your comments will be confidential)

A personal thought on your second anecdote:
I think your group was working off an assumption since there were no men in the group you mentioned... Why do they think being vulnerable is attractive? As a male in the field "vulnerable" women (admittedly more so than men) make me feel like I have to carry them as well as myself... I would prefer someone who could take care of herself. Maybe that's just me personally but I'm honestly not particularly attracted to vulnerable women.

A personal prejudice I've just stumbled on:
I do find that I'm unconsciously more willing to let a guy fail at a task (in CS or whatever) but feel more inclined to help a woman in the field. I guess I'm afraid if they fail they'll want to leave? As a TA I definitely gave women more encouragement e.g.  "-1 incorrect, but good thought process" but with guys I would just write "-1".]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The following piece is a re-post from the <a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/">Columbia Daily Spectator</a>, where I am an opinion blogger. The original may be found <a href="http://spectrum.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/speaking-in-tongues">here</a>.</em>

"I thought about using a static framework like <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> or <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a> so that I could write in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and commit and push from the terminal, but then I realized it would be a pain to blog from the remote so I cloned this repo on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> to hack Wordpress to run on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> for free using <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>", I responded casually to my roommate this summer, a fellow hacker/scientist, when she asked me what platform I would be using to start my writing blog.

My sister, a "normal" human being used to answers like "Blogger" or "Wordpress", overhearing our exchange on Skype, laughed and said to me, "You guys are literally speaking another language. It's like hearing robots talk or something."

While I don't think I'm quite on the level of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxVHsWlE7hE">R2D2</a> (at least not yet), I am aware of how much like gibberish it can sound when you catch me in animated discussion with another CS-er about some software or algorithm. One minute English, the next minute we hit some topic, and boom, off we go rattling off in Nerdspeak.

And although Computer Science is definitely one of the more jargon-y fields, thanks to its highly technical nature and the extreme "in-group" culture, this phenomenon is not limited to the subject. 

Catch any of my friends at Columbia, be they budding lawyers, doctors, musicians, physicists, philosophers, or artists talking to a peer in the field, and soon it feels like there's either cotton in my ears or a metal plate around my brain.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore talking nerdy. But sometimes I worry that too much jargon gets in the way of our ability to learn more and connect with interesting characters. This is especially crucial in our college years—one of the only times in which we will have the opportunity to be surrounded by so many talented, passionate people in other industries. What good is this talent if we cannot comprehend it—or worse yet, fear to ask?

Even within the same field, similar problems arise. Excessive terminology can create an aura of "exclusivity" and turn away those who might not fit the culture bill but possess ample aptitude otherwise. I know firsthand that in Computer Science, women are often deterred from becoming developers due to this sort of "insider's club" (usually summed up as "pale and male"). In a field that values so much open-source and transparency, and that has traditionally welcomed those with interest and skill without regard to superficial traits, it seems almost sacrilegious to build such barriers.

As undergraduates, and as scholars for life, we are not quite such specialists that our learnings are incomprehensible to our peers, nor should they ever have to be. I have found that the best way for me to learn is by teaching and reiterating what I know, especially to children and to friends in drastically different studies. There's something exhilarating and addictive about discussing a topic we love in the words we share with other aficionados, and special terms are often of course necessary for special topics.

But something special need not be secret, nor our attitudes towards "special" knowledge childish—or worse yet, elitist.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Congrats! we made it. despite threats of superstorms, presidential elections and a mayan apocalpyse, here we are, for the most part whole, stumbling headaches and all into the year 2013.

I will be the first to admit that I love making lists: to-do lists, to-don't lists, shopping lists, restaurant lists, playlists... but to be perfectly honest, most of the time I get a whole lot more out of writing lists than following them. In fact, oftentimes I will spend a good deal of time thoughtfully assembling bullet points, only to never even glance at them again.

therefore, the practicality of New Year's Resolutions remains doubtful. Let's be frank: I have no idea what I decided to promise my self last year, and even less idea of whether I achieved it or not. And it was still a pretty freaking good year anyway, and one i feel was absolutely essential in the development of self and character.

anyway, like i said, i really do enjoy making lists, so why the heck not. so without further ado, some resolutions, in no particular order, and varying degrees of importance:

1. This one's really important, and is a general goal I'd like to make the theme of 2013/life: to keep an open mind. Computer Science has taught me really wonderful life skills (patience, making REALLY CLEAR AND EXPLICIT ALGORITHMIC INSTRUCTIONS SERIOUSLY when telling someone what to do, creativity, etc.) but unfortunately it has also somewhat increased my already present tendency to view things as binary. I'm somewhat hot-headed and a whole lotta stubborn, so it's very, very easy for me to jump to binary (GOOD || BAD) conclusions about things right off the bat, when in reality, this can be a silly, not to mention dangerous, practice. And if 2013's taught me anything at all, people (and life) are constantly full of surprises.

2. Have better study habits, seriously. OK so I know this one is really run-of-the-mill and y'all are yawning but as I always tell myself if only, only I stopped shopping online in all my lectures for the first 5 weeks of the semester this would save me a LOT of panic later.

3. Stop pulling up my jeans by the pockets because the pockets start ripping and yes I know this is a random-ass resolution BUT it is important and hey it fulfills the characteristic of a well-formed resolution being both succinct and specific.

4. In contrast to the previous, try to live life with more focus on the present space and dimension. I have a mind that feasts on large, abstract concepts and likewise has a tendency to fixate on abstract worries and puzzles. there are some issues that simply cannot be resolved within the current brainspace and timespace-- and i have to learn to be comfortable with that. Not every worry and problem has a closed-form solution and I need to get that through my stubborn head and focus on matters at hand.

5. And a light(er) positive one to finish off: continue to be involved with performance groups at school! Seriously, it brings much needed perspective to schoolwork and a different sense of accomplishment.

6. Just kidding, one more: Yoga! Yoga really, really does me well.

7. Oops, really, really just one more: make a conscious effort to stop being flaky. I used to get so annoyed about people not living up to their plans-- that was, until I became so busy this semester I started missing social obligations left and right. Yes, I will always have code to write, and sometimes that code is really important, but no one likes being stood up for a last minute NLP assignment 3 days past its due date. (If you are one of the many people this happened to this semester I am really sorry but sometimes code gets really needy and i promise i value our time.)

What are your New Year's Resolutions (if you believe in resolutions, otherwise what would be your pretend resolutions if you are already perfect etc.) ?

*Oh wait, I just found last year's resolutions! now this is entertaining... (Although it does seem like I made good headway on a very important one-- to stop calling myself "stupid" when problems get tough--a bad habit I found to be very counterproductive, and for the most part, untrue.)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Absolutely loving <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/302696/">this article</a> on understanding introversion from <em>The Atlantic</em>. Introversion seems to have a resoundingly negative connotation in (Western) society, which is a real shame, considering that it is estimated 'a minority in the regular population but a majority in the gifted population' identify as such.

Why has calling someone an introvert become such a bad name? There is an idea that to succeed in the business and political world, one must be outspoken and outgoing, and thrive off the energy of others, which defines the traits of extroversion. Parents are constantly egging their toddlers to be "less shy", and worry when they occasionally refuse to socialize. These unfair stereotypes even tread the territories of areas closer to our heart-- the author, Jonathan Rauch, sympathizes: "Female introverts, I suspect, must suffer especially. In certain circles, particularly in the Midwest, a man can still sometimes get away with being what they used to call a strong and silent type; introverted women, lacking that alternative, are even more likely than men to be perceived as timid, withdrawn, haughty", which I can state as true from personal experience.

Misunderstanding plays a key role in the perpetration of the Introvert Myth. Introversion is <em>not</em> equivalent to shyness; this is a grave and unfortunate mixup. Neither is it misanthropy; the central characteristic of introversion is that we "find other people tiring", not that we don't like them. Many people are surprised to find that I identify as an introvert; after all, I am a very vocal student, a big fan of public speaking, and enjoy meeting new people. I love nothing more than animated discussions with people whose ideas intrigue me. 

Yet at the end of the day, I need a large portion of time to be alone with my thoughts. It is both a mental and physical necessity; my body literally repulses from the thought of others invading my mental space. If I am not granted this peace, my intellectual and emotional state will literally deteriorate; it is "recharge" time from social interactions, and the way I am able to perform challenging mental tasks on a daily basis at school and/or work. Yet, due to the commonly accepted myths of introversion, I find that people who do not know me well are often confused or worse yet offended by my need to be alone when I so clearly have the skills to socialize, which is a real shame.

Failing to recognize and respect introversion is highly problematic as it can lead to deteriorating business and personal relationships and injustice at large. My own case is only a small and rather weak example, as I do not test extremely introverted, and can sustain interaction with people for extended chunks of time (as in, more than 24 consecutive hours) if necessary. In fact, an estimated 25% of the population identify as such, although the real percentage is likely higher.

For more, read <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/302696/">the article</a>. And then, leave me alone. (Just kidding. Somewhat.)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>This word feminist, I do not think it means what you think it means</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To date I have never attend a Gender Studies class, read any Betty Friedan, burned any of my bras (those things are damn expensive) or gone more than a week without shaving. Sometimes I wear lipstick; sometimes I wear heels. Sometimes I even cook breakfast for men I care about; but only if they do the dishes in exchange. I have an apron that's pink and somewhat frilly, and sometimes I wear this too, because it has nice pockets and is a souvenir from a great vacation in Tokyo. I support and admire women of strength and of power, and I am pro-female. This does not entail that I necessarily hate men; the world does not exist in binary forms and if there is any animosity, it is merely annoyance in a stereotypical form of frustration between the sexes. I do not know what this word feminist means, because I have never looked it up in the dictionary.

But evidently, it must mean something to me. I have been told before that I am a feminist and sometimes I call myself one for the sake of simplifying arguments. It seems that I have even labeled some of my writing so. 

And evidently, it must mean something to others if only that sometimes men roll their eyes at me and women become inexplicably either suddenly warm or colds towards me. Anything that warrants such a viceral reaction deserves to be explained, if even for the mere reason that I avoid strife and find it off-putting to say the least that one should ever react to me in a negative way for mere use of a label. The only other adjective of similiar scope that has been undeniably placed upon me seems to be Asian, and if one were to react in the same way to that label, it would be called Racism, and unacceptably so. 

And so now that I am 20, a nice even number, exactly a prime number's worth of decades, it seems to be a good time to evaluate what that f-word means before I go on, as I am neither so young as to bear it irresponsibly, nor too old to re-evaluate.

Here is what the New Oxford American Dictionary says:

Feminist
<i>noun</i> 
a person who supports feminism.
<i>adjective</i>
of, relating to, or supporting feminism: feminist literature.

which is an utterly useless definition.
And so we must look one step up, to feminism itself, which means:

Feminism
<i>noun</i>
the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.

Which sounds to me a sane and rational cause to support, even self-evident.
I do not know really why one should have such a negative reaction to this well-meaning and logical definition, but I do not claim to have a thorough understanding of the behavior of people on the whole. All I wish to emphasize is that this word seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with the cooking of food, cleaning of kitchens, dressing and portrayal of bodies, hatred of men, or most puzzling of all, lesbianism. And with that definition in mind, I can confidently say that yes, I am a feminist, in the true sense of the word, which is, after all, how words ought to be used, and perhaps you should, too.

<i>P.S.: I am notoriously bad at detecting sarcasm so if you are in the same boat as I there is some of that in the above. </i>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is something about Trains that I Like. Out of planes and trains and automobiles they to me are the most romantic. Nine-eleven sort of killed flying and even before that I always hated being in the air. What a cruel trick this was, I thought, as a child, to call it flying but being so utterly trapped in my seat, the opposite of free.

Cars were nice enough; I just didn't like driving them. It was as if all the worst stereotypes joined forces (Asian; woman; short-tempered; small) and at 5'1'' I could barely look over the steering wheel clearly. Once I had a conversation in the basement of a boy I convinced myself I loved in high school, about what the spirit of a car looked like. The beer was brown and in a glass (this was in the end of college when I first learned that beer was meant for a cold tall glass) and he said the spirit of a car in its highest form was a thing of beauty, because really, this was the spirit of a free man. And when you drove that car, really, you were just taking that thing of beauty where it wanted to most go. I thought that was fine as long as a thing of beauty was driving the car itself and I was free to look at both.

But trains. Trains were lovely because you were always moving but you never had to worry about how. There was something blue collar about them and it was great; you ran down the stairs in Penn Station onto the platform with all the hordes of tired businessmen with their beer in brown paper bags the smell of artificial butter popcorn in the air; shooting the shit with the conductors, sometimes jolly more often tired. And best of all you could look out the window and see the grass roll by; it was best especially in New England when the leaves changed and when you rolled past Connecticut dreaming of what doctors and dolled-up wives were behind those white picket fences. Then you thought it would be nice to be invited somewhere fancy for a change because then you could wear sparkly things like the best of them and be admired, but you were raised too pridefully to ever desire such things. To be rich. To be a decorative. It was folly.

And you were always going somewhere. I am talking only about American trains, I can't speak for any other kinds. It was the American train I loved with those dreams of railroads and going to New York with just a backpack, a handle of bourbon in it and a note from your sweetheart. Maybe going up North through Appalachians and all you had was some E.E. Cummings with you and some pen and paper to write the next big thing. You with all the drunks and suits and so long as it wasn't St. Patrick's day on the New Jersey transit it was all beautifully coarse. It was so Americana; and this to a little Chinese American girl was somehow the best thing of all, even if the Amtrak was making nothing but debt and really the tracks weren't very safe, and no one could afford a damn ticket anyway.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the ages of 5-15, my life was mainly defined by one thing: reading. I used to devour books, going to the library and taking out 5-10 novels on a weekly basis. I attribute all my academic and personal success to this early interest in the written word-- I was pretty impatient and chatty as a child, but reading calmed me down and taught me how to focus. It was also where I learned to be a writer, and furthermore a DIY-tinkerer in many other fields: sewing, cooking, fashion and design. Without the help of books I really do not think I would be where I am today-- literally. My entrance essay to Columbia was a narrative about growing up in the library, and I wouldn't have gained admission without it.

Fast forward half a decade, and it seems that two things that seemed so plentiful in youth-- reading and sleeping-- has suddenly become a luxury, saved for long commutes, winter breaks, and post-exam recoveries. It's sort of a shame that the book has to be put on the back burner, since there's always so much to explore, but the reality is that when I pick up a book, I don't stop till the last page, homework be damned. Still, I've been trying to reacquaint with an old friend, the Novel, ever since spring break. I figure some casual reading, in lieu of TV or Internet time, can't be too much of a time sap, and is often much more relaxing and stimulating.

For those of you equally busy studying and working women and men, I urge you to join me! Here two fast-paced books that I really enjoyed to get you started. I'd love to hear recommendations of your own! What books have you read recently (or even old favorites)?

LAZY SUNDAY READING RECOMMENDATIONS 1

The theme this week is foodie reading. Some kitchen-centric books out there are just poorly written (I'm talking to you, <em>Julie and Julia</em>), and others are fun, but more cookbooks than novels. Here are two that are, in the eyes of this reading aficionado, true works of literature composed by authors who are craftsmen in the art of the pen as well as the cutting board. There's something really addictive, gritty, and visceral reading about kitchen life. Food memoirs are often extremely vivid and almost erotic-- as the co-owner of Mario Batali's famed restaurant's mother points out to the author-- "What else do you put in another person's body?" a great recipe for a testosterone-charged romp.

1. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heat-Adventures-Pasta-Maker-Apprentice-Dante-Quoting/dp/1400034477">Heat</a></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heat-Adventures-Pasta-Maker-Apprentice-Dante-Quoting/dp/1400034477">, by Bill Buford</a>

I'm currently working midway this novel, but have enjoyed it so much thus far that I present it to you with no qualms. Bill Buford, former fiction-editor of <em>the New Yorker</em>, decides on a whim to leave his position as a comfortable journalist to become Mario Batali's newest kitchen slave. The writing is excellent and the duality between Buford and Batali's own journey as a chef is fascinating. A must-read for anyone who's ever enjoyed <em>Iron</em><em> Chef</em>, especially if you've watched it in the originally dubbed-over Japanese.

2.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Bones-Butter-Inadvertent-Education/dp/0812980883"><em> Blood, Bones, &amp; Butter</em>, Gabrielle Hamilton</a>

I have yet to check out Hamilton's popular restaurant <em>Prune</em>, but my friend, who visited for brunch a few weeks back, told me that it was fantastic. With writing and passion like this, I have no doubts. <a href="http://bloodbonesandbutter.net/excerpt/">Read an excerpt here</a> for a sample of Hamilton's great writing style-- especially in her descriptions of a semi-charmed childhood, and rougher teenage years.

		<title>How to Model: Markov Chains</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[</i>One should usually not take advice on modeling from a 5-foot tall nerdy asian girl, that is, unless it's Data Modeling we're talking about. (Whether or not you should take my advice then is up to your own discretion.) This summer, I'm interning at an education technology company, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a>, where I have to great opportunity to model student behavior with real data. I'm learning a ton about what it takes to be a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Data Scientist</a>, although what concerns me more is the Scientist part, since the term is a bit of a buzzword anyway. Along the way, I figured I'd share some tidbits of knowledge with you. This post is <b>specifically</b> targeted towards <b>non-technical</b> people: my goal is to explain things in such a clear way that anyone with a healthy curiosity should be able to comprehend. I will focus on examples and fun demos, since that's how I learn best. Feedback appreciated!</i>

WHAT IS A MARKOV CHAIN?
A Markov chain, named after <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov">this great moustached man</a> is a type of mathematical system composed of a finite number of discrete <i>states</i> and transitions between these states, denoted by their <i>transition</i> probabilities. The most important thing about a Markov Chain is that it satisfies the <b>Markov Property: that each state depends only on the state directly proceding it* and no others.</b> This <i>independence assumption</i> makes a Markov Chain easy to manipulate mathematically. (*This is a Markov Chain of degree 1, but you could also have a Markov Chain of degree <i>n</i> where we look at the past <i>n</i> states only.) A Markov Chain is a specific kind of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process">Markov Process</a> with discrete states.

A VISUAL
That's a lot of words for a concept that is in fact very simple. Here's a picturesque example instead:

Imagine that you are a small frog in a pond of lily pads. The pond is big but there are a countable (discrete) number of lily pads (states). You start on one lily pad (start state) and jump to the next with a certain probability (transition probability). When you're on one lily pad, you only think of the next one to jump to, and you don't really care about what lily pads you've jumped on in the past (memoryless).

That's all!

WHY DO WE USE IT?
Markov Chains have many, many applications. (Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_Markov_chains">this Wikipedia page</a> for a long list.) They're useful whenever we have a chain of events, or a discrete set of possible states. A good example is a time series: at time 1, perhaps student S answers question A; at time 2, student S answers question B, and so on.

A RANDOM TEXT GENERATOR
Now, for the fun part!

For Knewton's company hackday, I've built a text analysis "funkit" that can perform a variety
of fun things, given an input text file (corpus). You can clone the source code <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sbchou/Parakeet">here</a>. Don't worry if the word "cloning" sounds very scifi, you can check out the README that I've written (residing in that link) for detailed instructions on how to use the code. As long as you have python installed on your computer (Macs come pre-installed) you should be fine and dandy.

What we're most interested in is the parrot() function. This is the "Markov Chain Babbler" or Random Text Generator that mimics an input text. (Markov Chain Babblers are used to generate <a target="_blank"href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">Lorem Ipsums (text fillers)</a> such as this wonderful <a target="_blank" href="http://slipsum.com/">Samuel L. Ipsum example</a>.

Included are a few of my favorite sample "corpuses" (scary word for sample text) taken from Project Gutenburg, it includes:

"memshl.txt" which is the complete Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes
"kerouac.txt", an excerpt from On the Road
"aurelius.txt", Marcus Aurelius' Meditations
and finally, "nietzsche.txt", Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil.

Here's a prime snippet of text generated using the Nietzsche corpus, of length 100, one of my favorites:

"CONTEMPT. The moral physiologists. Do not find it broadens and a RIGHT OF RANK, says with other work is much further than a fog, so thinks every sense of its surface or good taste! For my own arts of morals in the influence of life at the weakening and distribution of disguise is himself has been enjoyed by way THERETO is thereby. The very narrow, let others, especially among things generally acknowledged to Me?.. Most people is a philosophy depended nevertheless a living crystallizations as well as perhaps in"

Despite being "nonsense", it captures the essence of the German philosopher quite well. If you squint a little, it doesn't take much imagination to see this arise from the mouth of Nietzsche himself.

Here's some Kerouac text, too:

"Flat on a lot of becoming a wonderful night. I knew I wrote a young fellow in the next door, he comes in Frisco. That's rights. A western plateau, deep one and almost agreed to Denver whatever, look at exactly what he followed me at the sleeping. He woke up its bad effects, cooked, a cousin of its proud tradition. Well, strangest moment; into the night, grand, get that he was sad ride with a brunette. You reckon if I bought my big smile."

HOW IT WORKS
Parakeet generates text using a simple level-1 Markov Chain, just like we described above. Let's break it down:

1. We read the input file and "tokenize" it-- in other words we break it up into words and punctuation.
2. Now, for each word in text, we store every possible next word that follows it. We do this using a Python dictionary, aka a hash table.

For example, if we have the following sentence,
"the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time"

We have the following dependencies:

{',': ['the', 'mad', 'mad', 'desirous'],
 'are': ['the', 'mad'],
 'at': ['the'],
 'be': ['saved'],
 'desirous': ['of'],
 'everything': ['at'],
 'for': ['me'],
 'live': [','],
 'mad': ['ones', 'to', 'to', 'to'],
 'me': ['are'],
 'of': ['everything'],
 'ones': [',', 'who'],
 'only': ['people'],
 'people': ['for'],
 'same': ['time'],
 'saved': [','],
 'talk': [','],
 'the': ['only', 'mad', 'ones', 'same'],
 'to': ['live', 'talk', 'be'],
 'who': ['are']}

Note that in this naive (non-space smart) implementation of the text generator, when we have duplicate occurances of next words, for example
 'mad': ['ones', 'to', 'to', 'to'], we store it once each time.

3. Now the fun part. Say we want to generate a paragraph of 100 words. First, we randomly choose a <i>startword</i>, that is capitalized first word. Now, we randomly choose a next word from its list of next words (since frequent next words will have many duplicates, it will be chosen more often), and from that word, continue the process till we achieve a paragraph of length 100.

WHY IS THIS A MARKOV PROCESS?
Well, when we build up our paragraphs, we choose our next word based only on the choices generated by our current word. Doing so, we ignore the history of previous words we have chosen (which is why many of the sentences are nonsensical), yet since each choice of the next word is logical based on the current one, we end up with something that emulates the writing style (chaining).

SOURCE CODE:
Check out my code on github, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sbchou/Parakeet">located here</a>. Simply fire up your terminal, and type "git clone the-url", and it will copy the repo into a directory on your local machine. Further instructions are in the README.

		<title>at what price can we label &quot;good education&quot;?</title>
		<link>http://blog.sophiechou.com/2013/at-what-price-can-we-label-good-education/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I pose to you today a question that I wish for you to consider, as you re-enter your classrooms and dormrooms and lecture halls (that is, if, you, like me, are a university student; else, perhaps as you send your sons and daughters and friends back to such similiar places).

What is the price of a good education?

It is true, of course, that on some level a good education <em>has no price</em>. For knowledge is both priceless and infinitely valuable.

But this is not how, for all intents and purposes, we are taught to think in pragmatic life, or at least not at our present state and nation; and this you must surely know, for even public schooling is not truly free, paid for students in the form of taxes and subsidies and other pecuniary means. Budget cuts, tax increases: these are the buzzwords we often hear in the political arena with respect to education. I, for one, loyal to my liberal stance, default to protest the cut of funding for schools and cheer programs to increase its quality. Yet at what point may we say, <em>STOP</em>? and when must we say, <em>GO</em>?

I am an undergraduate of Columbia University, surely among the most expensive educations in the world. The raw cost of 1 year's tuition is $45,028.00; with financial aid and scholarship, it becomes incrementally more affordable, but even so, an enormous sum (and not all Universities provide such great financial support). Surely, at this price, my education must be nonparallel; and in some ways, this is in fact true, and I am extremely fortunate.

But if we may read the quality of education as proportional to its price, and thusly say that this is truly the <em>highest quality of education</em> that humanity can provide at this moment, than I reply that humanity must be in a very sorry state indeed.

In the first 2 days of courses this semester I can already count 2 classrooms that had not enough seats for students; 3 that were over-registered. In one class more than 10 students sat on the floor for the duration of the nearly 2 hour lecture below the vision of the professor; in another, students were encouraged to sit on window ledges rather than crowd the aisles on a day of 7°F wind chills.

This is one of the highest price tags for education in the world; and if at 45,028.00 dollars we cannot provide even the bare essentials for students (a place to sit and the ability to both see and hear the lesson), it frightens me to hear at what tuition hike this may be proposed feasible.

I have, of course, no definite answers, and my question of price is less about money than to suggest a point about the usage of that money and the approach that the society in which I live takes to approach the education question. It is a question that, as a student, one has a responsibility to ponder, and that I hope to explore, and I ask you to do the same.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are people whom I admire and then there are people for whom every moment I spend with them, I want to soak up every possible molecule of being in their presence. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/arts/dance/06kour.html?pagewanted=all">Tai Jimenez</a> is one of those people. Her dance class can only be described as a spiritual experience, because the focus is never on just the steps, but the <i>intent</i> and <i>purpose</i> of every step.

And <i>that</i> is what ballet should be all about. It should be a artistic and introspective <i>life-long</i> practice, just like yoga or meditation, because it is a beautiful and thoughtful practice. In reality, this is just about the polar opposite of how things tend to go down: even in the small beans non-professional no-name classes I go to, bitches be fightin’ for the barre, and everyone is feeling extra fat in their tights today. It’s a hierarchy of competition and insecurity that dissuades people and stifles creativity, even though the medium is so ripe for creation. Not always, of course, but often enough that it’s always a shadow chasing close behind the joy of movement.  On a larger scale, this feeling works in tandem with existing institutions that reward people of a certain build, skin color, class, and attitude, not always for the best results.

<i>(This is often how I feel about the tech industry and academia as well.)</i>

Anyway. Tai, who also writes, posts a great response on her blog to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Martins">Peter Martin</a>, the chairman of the School of American Ballet (SAB), when he asks her to join a new “diversity initiative” for the SAB. As the all-too-frequent token girl / token minority in many lab settings past, present, and future, to whom all the “women in tech”, “minority”, “gender”, and “diversity” inquiries are directed, I can relate to her frustration. Her response is gold:

<i>“I have been giving the matter of whether or not to join the Diversity Committee some thought. With all due respect, if the School of American Ballet is serious about diversifying, they can start by hiring me as a ballet teacher. I am great.</i>

<i>This is not about me, and it is about me. Please tell Peter Martins that true diversity means the whole structure has to change. Is he ready for that?”</i>

In a follow-up blogpost, she explains:

<i>“My approach to teaching ballet is too different from theirs. They want to create dancers. I want to create an ecstatic moment of dancing. They teach one to master a certain style and technique. I teach dance as a tool for self-mastery. They teach people how to squeeze themselves into a certain look. I teach people how to love themselves as they are and to dance from there. They promote an ideal. I expose the myth. They teach competition. I foster community. They teach hierarchy. I restore sovereignty of self. They pick favorites. I acknowledge everyone’s medicine and stir it up good.</i>

<i>And sometimes, I play hip-hop. SAB ain’t ready for this jelly.”</i>

Read her original posts <a href="http://taijimenez.com/2015/04/28/letter-from-peter-martins-and-my-response/">here</a> and <a href="http://taijimenez.com/2015/05/25/follow-up-to-the-peter-martins-letter-and-a-special-offer/">here</a>. And, if you’re in the Cambridge/Boston area, definitely, definitely take a class with Tai! She teaches at  Harvard (the classes are open registration) and I believe <a href="http://jndance.com/classes/">Jeanette Neil</a>’s.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, for the first time in years, I picked up a copy of the newspaper in the morning.

I didn’t buy it from the drugstore, like my dad would on Sundays when I was little. And I didn’t pick it up from the driveway, like I would have in high school, shaking off condensation from  its plastic wrapper. Instead, I had literally picked up off the desk of another, when I saw it lying there. It wasn’t even fresh news; it was from last Wednesday, and he in turn had gotten it for free at the student center.

Still. It was attractive all the same, that copy of more-than-Yesterday’s news. I slipped it under my arm, and went out the door. I took it with me, on the subway, and felt more Manhattanite than I had ever felt in my life. Here I was, boots and all, on my way downtown for a coffee meeting, and here, by my side, was the New York Times. When i got to the cafe, I realized that I had gotten ink all over my fingers. I had forgotten that newspapers smudged, and it gave me a secret joy.

In 2014, it is widespread knowledge that newspapers are Dinosaurs. Printed news is rapidly going extinct and the new forms of Media that replace it suffer from existential and identity crises. Is longform a thing of the past? Is there even a need for Journalism School? Will it all just be listicles from here on out? (If so, I’m moving to Walden Pond.)

I maintain that there is, and always will be, a need for well-executed, professional Journalism. Whether or not there exists a profitable market, however, is another question. How do we ensure the financial means to support the field?

It’s a good question, one that neither I nor anyone else that I know of has the answer to. The transition from paper to digital isn’t a simple transcribing from one medium to the other. Profit models do not translate. Most significant are the psychological shifts that occur. Newspapers, and their institutions, are built on history, legacy, and tradition. By decentralizing news distribution with the internet, the castle collapses.

When you remove the physicality of the paper, you remove its nostalgic power. That is a great power, and it should never be underestimated in the human psyche. Turning the pages, familiar faces smile back-- Dowd, Bruni, Bittman, Wells, bringing me back to familial scenes of kitchen tables and coffee. Jumping over paywalls, those same names feel antagonistic and  elitist on the web. Whereas I would easily pay a dollar or two for a fat stack of paper, the Internet, with its culture of free information, incites the hacker in me to do everything in my power to take what I can.

Opening the paper on the subway is a symbol, one that denotes a certain level of education, class, and age. It is a desirable thing to own. On an iPad, a phone, or laptop, all of that is lost. It could be the Post, it could be Ulysses, it could be Fifty Shades of Gray-- who knows?

The newspaper from WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2014 sits beside me still, keeping company with the coffee that has long grown cold.  When I finish writing, both of them will go into the trash. 

 “All the News That’s Fit to Print”, it says, somewhat forebodingly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">American Apparel, that hipster clothing/disco neon hotpants empire, has always been of dubious moral grounds. Despite its loud proclamations of “made in America”, the company is in fact run by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Charney#Controversy">a Canadian </a>charged of sexual harassment lawsuits at least five times in the last decade. Not to mention the softcore-porn style ads, that is, only when <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/42717/think-american-apparel-isn-t-sexist-maybe-this-will-convince-you">the model is female</a>. Even if all of this weren’t true, when’s the last time you need a gold metallic pleather thong leotard for upwards of fifty dollars? (Please don’t answer that.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">The store is, however, very convenient for basic cuts in solid colors (v-necks, A-line skirts, etc.), which is why I stopped by one this weekend, to hopefully find a white crop-top at an okay price. The answer unsurprisingly turned out to be no.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a moment of desperation, I flipped through the childrens’ tees to hopefully find a size large or extra large. (Don’t even ask why a company that features topless women in their ads makes childrens’ clothing; there is a time and a place for sexuality and it shouldn’t be at a store frequented by preteens and young children).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lo and behold, I made the discovery that a women’s extra small crop top at American apparel is equivalent in size to a child’s size six tshirt. That’s six years old! Sure, some liberties might be taken for the cropping part, but basically American Apparel expects that a small woman should have the same chest girth as a kindergartener.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m a pretty petite person, but I’m not sure on what nation or even planet you might expect women to be the size of a tiny six-year old. That’s some f-ed up idea of body image.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[the story below was first posted by me on my food blog, accompanied with a recipe for <a href="http://www.pikachews.com/2013/12/persimmon-goat-cheese-salad/">Persimmon Goat Cheese Salad</a>.

<em>the Persimmon Tree</em> 

A few years ago, when I was a grumpy senior in High School, the beloved Magnolia tree in our backyard, source of pink blossoms, rambling branches to climb, and many childhood memories passed away. In its place, my parents went to an Asian nursery and brought back a Persimmon tree.

The tree was thin, crooked, and distinctly budget. Maybe there was some haggling involved. I didn’t like it. I wanted a cherry tree, with fluffy pink blossoms. I wanted an apple tree, something that smacked of wholesomeness and Americana. Instead, my parents got something “Oriental”, that I argued had no retail value when the time came to sell our little house and yard (a low blow, since both my parents and I are firmly attached to the idea of growing old in the same place).

The first year in our yard, the squirrels ate nearly all the blossoms. They bit off many thin twigs and branches, leaving a massacre on the grass. What was left turned into small hard fruits, and the wrist-thin trunk sloped to one side.

I went to school. I didn’t call very much, and I forgot about our tree and our backyard.

But my parents took care of the tree and it grew into a beautiful little thing. Now it bears dozens and dozens of fruit– more than a couple of empty-nesters can eat. The pretty orange persimmons hang like Christmas globes on the small but staunch tree.

By nature there are two types of persimmons– astringent types, which unless utterly ripe to the point of bursting, leave a nasty “furry” feeling on the tongue, and non-astringent types, which can be eaten at any stage of ripeness, always lovely and mild. Our little tree is non-astringent. The fruits are always sweet.

Every Thanksgiving now my parents bring a bucketful to my aunt and uncle’s house, and I take the leftovers back to school. When my mom was a child, persimmons were big and squishy and plentiful and overlooked as a poor man’s fruit. Everyone wanted red American apples and bananas that were yellow. The grocer would say, these bananas have been on a plane– now, have you been on a plane? because a little Chinese girl isn’t much more than a banana. Now, I savor them, a day at a time, to make the harvest last.

Each one reminds me of my parent’s love and my roots– that I am not as American as apple pie, but that the fruit is sweeter still.

		<title>race as a proxy for conversation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Preface: I am taking a class in Race and Racism this semester with Sally Haslanger at MIT, fulfilling my deepest desires of having classes in philosophy count towards my degree. I figured I would cross-post my weekly responses and thoughts here, so that you may read them and form a few thoughts of your own.</em>

<span style="font-size: 13px;">As we continue our discussion of race and its existence, I'm beginning to wonder if the question is of race itself at all but rather ethnicity, which seems to be far less of a hot topic in the national conversation.</span>

If the past few weeks have been any indicator, there are literally centuries of philosophical, social, biological, and anthropological thought dedicated to the existence of race itself. All of it goes to show that the concept of race is one thing for certain-- unclear and likely socially constructed if it exists at all, or some tricky combination of social and biological, as Philip Kitcher argues in <i>“Race, Ethnicity, Biology, Culture”.</i>

<span>The concept of race in America is billed, literally and figuratively, as black-and-white, yet many of the problems of prejudice that make us uncomfortable refer to issues in shades of gray. <i> </i>Blanketing the discussion in a term which might not be defined in the first place obscures the conversations about what exactly it is that causes us unrest, and also leads to oversimplification, causing more harm than good.</span>

Take for example the complex bio-ethical issue of racial profiling and racial categorization for the sake of medicine. Now, there are two strains of racial thinking to take into consideration: one is the examination of race and health for the sake of research, and the other, more immediate use for racial categorization is in individual patient treatment. If a patient engages with a health-care provider and self-provides racial information, is it appropriate to take that into consideration? Now, what if the patient does not explicitly denote his or her race? And what if a patient is found unconscious and unresponsive? In which (if any) of these cases is racial information relevant ?

Burchard (<i>“The importance of Race and Ethnic Background in Biomedical Research and Clinical Practice”</i>) argues that because genetic clustering corresponds roughly to the five major racial groups, and genetic variation accounts for medically significant differences in disease outcome, by transitive property it is important to consider race as a factor in treatment and research.

Root (<i>“The Use of Race in Medicine as a Proxy for Genetic Differences”</i>), in response, would classify the above as an example of mistakenly using race as a proxy for other, more accurate genetic factors. Such habits are dangerous at the individual level, leading to statistical discrimination. Furthermore, racial data should not be considered even at the research level, because this reinforces racial groupings that are detrimental and politically harmful. Racial profiling is unacceptable in medicine because it is often a bad indicator of ancestry or other more import factors, such as environment.

<span>But what if race was taken out of the arguments entirely, and substituted with ethnicity? By the logic above, it seems that at least part of Roots argument for the immorality of race considerations disperses for ethnic categorization is far more associated with hereditary factors and cultural practices, and thus a better indicator of health. Burchard's argument in favor of racial information due to the correlation of socioeconomic factors still holds if we were instead to consider ethnicity in lieu of race. Would we still feel moral discomfort towards the blatant use of ethnicity as a factor in healthcare?

My instinct tells me yes; profiling is still discriminatory under any name. It seems already that Burchard's examples point to ethnic groups rather than racial groups; “Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians, the Amish, or European gypsies” are not a race and neither are Japanese people. But would a patient willingly be labeled as a “Jew” or a “Mexican”, and “American” or a “French Canadian”, even if that label provides more accurate insight into his or her health than a broader category? Such a practice would appear to dig up a whole slew of political and social issues; possibly concerns of anti-Semitism and nationalist interests. </span>

Too often, it seems that the topic of race serves as a proxy for the real issues that we fear to discuss-- issues of xenophobia, class, and social categorization, none of which are black and white, and exist whether or not race does.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Preface: I am taking a class in Race and Racism this semester with Sally Haslanger at MIT, fulfilling my deepest desires of having classes in philosophy count towards my degree. I figured I would cross-post my weekly responses and thoughts here, so that you may read them and form a few thoughts of your own.</em>

In this past week of class, we continued to mull on foundational questions of race itself core to the discussion of racism. Once again, we asked-- what is race, and does it exist, at all?

These are not questions that I had really considered before our class readings, and goes to show how ingrained racial thinking is on our minds. Even though I am quite aware of the notion of gender as a social construct, not once did the idea of race as a social construct occur to me, even after four years of schooling in a progressive college, whilst living in one of the most liberal and metropolitan cities in the world.

Sally drew this chart on the board classifying the views of some of the authors we read that I found very helpful.

&nbsp;
<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="141" /><col width="199" /><col width="284" /></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Beliefs</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Real</strong><strong> </strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Not</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Biological</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">Race Realist</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">Race Eliminativist</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Social</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">Social Constructionist</p>
</td>
<td>
<p dir="ltr">???</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<span style="font-size: 13px;">Thus, someone who believes that race is not biological is a race eliminativist; someone who believes that race is real, but only socially is a social constructionist, someone who believes that race is a real biological phenomenon is a race realist, and as far as we are aware there isn’t much of a name for people who believe that race is not socially real, since there are probably very few who think of it as such. Then there are also various combinations of the boxes above, and partial beliefs, such as race naturalists who believe that there are races biologically, but they could be very, very different from what we assume of races (and that is socially constructed).</span>

Appiah, one of the thinkers we discussed, argues against the existence of race from two fronts-- both ideationally (there exist no human beings that satisfy our assumptions of race) and refrentially (our usage of the term “race” have no human groupings to back them up). He might be someone we call a “race eliminativist”, although he approaches the concept from the usage of the term itself.

Yet, again, I argue, does this make the term any less valid? The ideational theorest would say that the concept/ideas associated with a term can be wrong and not apply to the referent-- for example, when I say “I have arthiritis in my thigh”, when in fact, no one does. But clearly, there is some sort of pain in my thigh, and whether or not I refer to it as arthritis, it still exists.

What strikes me the most of all the authors we have read and discussed so far, along with our own discussions of race, is what appears the desire to seek biological or logical proof, of the existence or non-existence of race. There is such a great emphasis to dispute, with sequential logical proofs, whether or not race exists, when the ramifications of race existing and all the issues that come with it are overwhelmingly related to the fields of politics, economics, and social class that have very little to do with biology (aside from testing and treatment of certain diseases and genetics, which is not to be dismissed). We seek a logical, scientific proof of the existence of race, yet issues of racial thinking and racism clearly cannot be approached in such matters.

In the 21st century we laugh easily at the Social Darwanist who so ignorantly argues about the skull size and brain size of different races, as this is clearly “scientifically incorrect” and racist thinking. Yet, we neglect that the science was in fact “correct” in that era, for science is never an absolute truth, but a function of time and place. That is something we often forget-- that science, is not objective but subjective, and grounded in its own system of human beliefs and ideologies. Behind every hypothesis is an inquiry about what we consider even worthwhile researching at all, and in every algorithm, human-chosen features to evaluate.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">We recently moved to a new office and in the process ordered some hardware: two google chromebooks, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/chrome-os-devices/XE503C32-K01US">the Samsung 13-inch chromebook 2</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although they are meant for web browsing and administrative tasks, I was curious and got my hands on one of the laptops to tinker around with for the afternoon. They're quite pretty machines, really nice display and feel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chrome OS isn't bad for what's it meant (using Chrome), but craving some Linux development power, I checked out <a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-to-install-linux-on-a-chromebook-and-unlock-its-ful-509039343">this tutorial on Lifehacker</a> to run Ubuntu with the help of <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">Crouton</a>, a tool that enables Ubuntu to run on top of Chrome OS, using the chroot command.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Confused? Don't be-- I found that, for once, the tutorial was crystal-clear, easy, and in a few steps and less than half an hour, I was up and running. Sweet!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here's my abbreviated version for running Unity.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to run Ubuntu Unity on Chromebook 2 with Crouton</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-to-install-linux-on-a-chromebook-and-unlock-its-ful-509039343">adapted from LifeHacker</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Obtain Chromebook. The one I had was a Samsung Chromebook 2, 13”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Turn it on, and set up the Chrome logins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Press and hold the Esc + Refresh keys together, and press the Power button while still holding the other two down. This will reboot into Recovery Mode.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Now, act quick! As soon as you see Recovery Mode pop up (screen with yellow exclamation point), press Ctr + D.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Press Enter to continue in Developer Mode when prompted.
6. Wait-- this will take a while to clear your data. A new screen will pop up for a few, then it will reboot and restart in Developer Mode. It’ll probably take 10 min or so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">7. Return to screen with red exclamation point (it will automatically go there), and don’t press anything! You’ll reboot into the Chrome OS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">8. Now for the fun part: time to install Crouton! Download it from the top of the page here: <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">9. Now pull up the terminal: press Ctrl + Alt + T, and type “shell”</p>
<p dir="ltr">10. To install Crouton: “sudo sh -e ~/path/to/crouton -t unity” (on a Chromebook Pixel, that’s “sudo sh -e ~/path/to/crouton -t touch,unity”, for touchscreen support.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">11. Wait for the install. When it’s done, it’ll ask you for a username and password.</p>
<p dir="ltr">12. Now, you’re ready to run the new desktop! “sudo startunity”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">13. Bam!</p>
<p dir="ltr">To switch back and forth between Chrome OS and Ubuntu, simply press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Back and Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Forward (if you’re on an ARM-based Chromebook) or Ctrl + Alt + Back and Ctr + Alt + Forward (if on Intel-based Chromebook). If so, you’ll also need to press Ctr + Alt + Refresh after.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cool thing is that there's zero speed penalty running Linux this way, instead of dual-booting; and you can shift between OS's with a simple keyboard-combo. The downside? Security, security, security.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the Crouton README: "Note that developer mode, in its default configuration, is completely insecure, so don't expect a password in your chroot to keep anyone from your data. crouton does support encrypting chroots, but the encryption is only as strong as the quality of your passphrase. Consider this your warning."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Discovering Khan Academy and Revisiting Online Learning </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm going to make this short and sweet because I am techinically in Ethics recitation right now but 8 pm is way too late for any non-nocturnal attention span, in my opnion.

A few months ago I wrote <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/thoughts-on-online-learning-and-the-value-of-a-college-degree/">a few thoughts</a> on Coursera and other online learning companies. You can read my critique <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/thoughts-on-online-learning-and-the-value-of-a-college-degree/">here</a> and also the thoughts of <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/some-other-voices-on-online-learning/">another writer</a>. In short, I argued that the idea of free knowledge is highly valueable, however virtual learning can never replace the priceless benefits of human-to-human interaction, and points to a serious need to <i>raise</i> the quality of university education.

At the time, I had never taken any online courses before or tried any of the programs. On principle I almost always prefer to speak with and learn from people in the flesh, and tend to be attracted to traditional modes of communication (paperback over e-book, etc.).

Fast forward to midterm season, where I suddenly find myself knee-deep in upcoming tests and no idea whatsoever of what the heck Gaussian-Jordan Elmination or the column space of a matrix is. My Linear Algebra professor, although incredibly well-meaning and intelligent, has a thick accent and ultimately a teaching style I just can't swallow. In come <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a> and <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">MIT Open Courseware</a> to the rescue-- concise, clear lectures (including those by the author of the textbook!) available on re-wind and at my desk. 5 hours of youTube videos later, my problem set no longer looks like a headache in matrix form.

I don't recant any of the things I previously stated. All the issues that I brought up remain unsolved. However, the potential of virtual education may be greater-- and more exciting-- than I previously imagined, and neither scary nor robotic. If there's a topic you need brushing up on or a subject that intruiges you, definitely don't hesitate to give it a try. This does not mean, however, that we need do away with the concrete classroom environment, only that both areas of education (virtual and traditional) remain endlessly improvable.

		<title>On the Cult of Passion</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a little late in coming, but I really, really like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/jobs/follow-a-career-passion-let-it-follow-you.html?smid=tw-share">this article</a> published in the nytimes. Without going into too much detail, since I highly encourage you to read it yourself, the piece, titled "Follow a Career Passion? Let it Follow You" debunks the idea that in order to be successful, you have to start chasing after that <b>one</b> and only dream job, something the author, CS professor at Georgetown Cal Newport calls "the Cult of Passion".

I see a lot of the detrimental effects of this "Cult" at Columbia. I, too, fell victim to its pressures when I was first starting out in Engineering school. I have always been a passionate learner and somewhat an academic "purist": learning for learning's sake, never for grades or awards. When I arrived at Columbia, for the first time in my life, I hated all of my classes. It destroyed my morale. The one course that I truly enjoyed-- a writing seminar-- ironically, caused me even <i>more</i> anxiety, since it had naught to do whatsoever with Engineering.

There is nothing wrong with encouraging young adults to pursue their dreams or find careers that inspire them. This is all very good and ideal. The old adage holds true: if you are doing something that you love, you <i>are</i> successful already.

However, this philosophy can be problematic because it puts unwarranted stress on career decisions, and moreover, really hurts those who have not yet "discovered" their "calling", which I think is a BS idea anyway. Combine that with the financial and societal pressure that comes with attending an elite school, and you have a lot of Ivy-League tears. It is nearly impossible to know at age 18 or 20 what you want to do for the rest of your life and <i>that's okay</i>: you <i>can't</i> know and if you do, you're probably wrong. 

The issue is intensified when very smart, very passionate indivduals have not yet figured out what makes them happy or what exact field they are enthusiastic about. In these situations, and under high pressure, the urge to slap on the passions of others-- perhaps a parent or a professor-- or subsitute alternate motives (money, power) becomes all too tempting. For those with a high drive to succeed and perfectionist tendencies, the option to quit or reevaluate, even when unhappiness ensues, may never occur. I am, and remain, highly doubtful that a career, or moreover life, driven by any of these motives could ever be truly fulfilling or even healthy.

Newport, now a professor, argues that his love for teaching has "nothing to do with figuring out at an early age that I was meant to be a professor", or even that there was anything special about his particular career path. The qualities that cause satisfaction in a career can be found in many areas-- and most of all, <i>they have to be earned</i>. What matters is not the choice you make-- but what you do once you have made the choice.

I could not agree more. I do not often use the word "love", but I say it without qualms that I truly love Computer Science. It is a fascinating field of study and I am an eager evangelist. In it I see reflections of myself: the connections to Plato and Aristotle through logic and philosophy, the magic of words and drafting something beautiful that I crave in writing. Sure, there is a lot of debugging and frustration in between, but it satisfies, and most of all, challenges me to be a better thinker. None of these traits are apparent to the non-Computer Scientist or even many Computer Scientists. That's because I took something that piqued <i>my</i> interests, and molded it into a passion.

I don't know if I want to be a developer 5 years, or even 2 years (after graduation), from now. That's because there is never only one right way or one right answer-- not even in science. I don't even know if my enthusiasm or GPA will survive this brutal semester of for and while loops. But I do know for sure that when it comes time to reeavaluate, I will try my best not to worry-- because I know that where hard work and dedication go, love will follow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the beginning of the seminar I'm taking in Race and Racism, we examined the historical origins of race-- smirking at 19th century attempts to neatly classify and digest mankind into square boxes of color, things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach">Blumenbach</a>'s 5 categories (Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian, American, Malay) and his offensive descriptions of the capabilities of each, how misguided they were, how clearly politically incorrect they are to us now.

One image stands out in particular-- a chart, on the left axis, the races; on the right, a marking in each category of human competence, such that, summing up the checked boxes, one might literally rank different humans against another by racial category. The White man wins, in every grouping. It's a glaring embodiment of early racist ideology, printed on paper, long since dismissed. It would be improbable to imagine a chart like that printed in a 21st century publication; the author would be fired, no doubt.

Yet the chart seemed eerily familiar to me. At first I couldn't place it; I hadn't seen it before. Then I realized: what it reminded me of was my own education, not in sociology or anthropology, but in Computer Science. As a graduate student, with a focus on Machine Learning and social applications, the very core of many of the algorithms I study and write is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">statistical classification</a>, a major topic of research. What we are doing now-- what Google does with its personalized search, what Facebook does with its unsettlingly accurate ads-- is automating that same thought process of 19th century anthropologists. We look at a person, here, her technological imprint on the web, the traces she leaves, her purchase history, friends, and log-ins, then say: “what sort of human being are you”? And then, using our charts and tables-- no longer printed ones, but weights on variables in our algorithms and databases of records-- we first classify her, and after, yes, we rank her (sometimes we rank her first and then classify her, as well). 

Users are commonly classified by gender, or what a machine can predict your gender to be, often quite accurately, and yes, different genders are ranked very differently. In the goods-driven world of online advertisement, a woman is worth differently than a man depending on what the product is, sometimes more, sometimes less. This entire pipeline is problematic to say the least; first, in the binary classification of gender; and then, in the ranking of different gendered individuals against one another; but our algorithms only reflect the constructs already driving these approaches.

Algorithms don't quite yet classify users by race, or at least not outloud, because race is such a charged issue in most countries. But that doesn't mean that when an algorithm doesn't label a category outright, it doesn't profile users. Algorithms, which learn, much like humans, based on history, only reinforce existing social constructs wherever they are used, because that is what they do: digest data, find a pattern, and make predictions according to that pattern. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/05/online-racial-profiling_n_2622556.html">Harvard Professor Latanya Sweeney</a> discovered that searches for racially-associated names were disproportionately causing targeted ads for criminal background checks and records to appear. These searches could go beyond offensive because targeted ads are reinforced by user behavior; if I click on that ad, I tell the machine that it was effective in targeting, reinforcing prejudiced thinking. Automated selection processes, which are beginning to gain popularity, such as automated admissions to schools and credit ratings, could cause real, harmful, physical ramifications.

This isn't to say that there is anything inherently “evil” in Machine Learning itself; it's a fascinating field of study, and could become a major tool in public health, disaster relief, and poverty alleviation. The machine is doing nothing new in its actions; it is merely a force multiplier of human behavior.  I believe that classification is core to human cognition; and yes, we label others upon contact, always.  Whether we like it or not, there is no way to escape being classified and classifying others. It's impossible to meet someone without assigning some kind of underlying worth to them; it sounds ugly out loud, but our classification are essentially value-laden in order to be useful. 

Ultimately, our machines only reflect our selves: it is vital to realize that computers are human, raised on human values, and there is no such thing as <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-010-9233-7">objective computation</a>. The question that remains is: what kind of value systems will we feed our algorithms?

		<title>tuning into creativity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I guess I haven't blogged in a long time because a) I've been busy and b) I'm hesitant to write unless I have something worthwhile to say. And while it is fun to rant, I want to avoid ranting my head off, because I do feel as if all I say ends up being a first-world problem sort of thing I need to re-evaluate my writing. It is as important to me to become a better writer as it is to get my thoughts across, and questions I want to ask myself more often are: <em>is this even good journalism</em>? And if not journalism, is this good fiction? Non-fiction? Etc. 

As I begin senior year, I finally have some space for electives, and as a result I'm trying to work on stretching my creativity in my spare time. This means just living with a sense of orbiting in a slightly different sphere than I do when I'm in hardcore analytic mode. I'm not sure if that even makes sense at all but it's 1:30 am right now and I'm avoiding my problem set.

The only analogy I have is this:
If you're bilingual, do you know that feeling, where you kind of just "tune in" to another language, not even switch gears but just slightly adjust the radio knob to receive a different wavelength? That's how I feel about the creative state of mind. You know that it's there and a language you can speak but there are others equally adequate and all of them interesting to use, but also that if you don't speak it for a while all of a sudden you're fumbling over verbs and names. Whatever language you use in your daily life will be the easiest and sharpest tool, but you know the feelings of the words and sounds of the mother tongue.

OK. That was also probably incoherent. Mostly I just mean that I'm trying to dedicate real time and effort to work on bending the only real Medium I possess on this Earth-- my body (and mind) to wring out even an ounce of art (and by art I mean feeling) from it: whether it be through movement, drawing, or fiction. I'm trying to really work on some purely expressive forms.

Guten Nacht!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[*caution: written while sleep deprived

every once in a while i'll have a word or two or maybe even a little phrase pop (no, more like slowly emerge) into my head and it will stick around for a week or so. actually, it's usually more of a thought snippet, a concept, an idea, but maybe everything is words because our thoughts in our brains are formed by words just like computer code stripped down to its barest is always just 1's and 0's.

then this word, phrase, thought, idea gently but firmly wraps over all the other thoughts running through my brain so that all the items are still there but there's a concrete yet transparent filament over it all making the view a little tinted, so you always see things in a slightly different hue. and so when there's not much going on, or maybe very much but very boring stuff, you can see the color most clearly.

anyway. two small creatures like that have been running through my mind lately, two words: families and trees. and maybe a third if you add the two together, family trees.

families

happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. but really are any families happy families? are they happy if the people within them are individually happy or is a happy family one that functions well within its frame? i do not know if there exists one single person who has a soley saccharine feeling towards one's family, (that within itself would be a cause for concern, because then we ask, does this person love his mother/father/child too much?) yet we all seem to love them regardless very much, (or in the least case attribute a great deal to them, whether it be good or bad) arguably even more so for there is satisfaction to be found in disagreement.  

i don't know around from around age 13 to age 24 or so i feel like one's job is to wean away from one's family, even strictly biologically yet still retaining this inner since of pride for one's relations (and the more belligerent they are how could you not) and somehow if we may be like human objects somewhere hidden inside there's always this invisible pointer to one's mother and father and them to theirs and through them siblings and cousins 

sources: brunch with my immediate family for the first time in a long time, a re-kindled hobby of googling my second cousin <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/newphotography/amanda-ross-ho/">amanda's work</a> on the internet, after her exhibit popped into my virtual mailbox via <a href="http://artcards.cc/">ArtCards</a>, our inheirent fascinations with ancestries, and because Freud said so

trees

the tree is a source of fascination because it is for most frequent uses of the word something very natural and physical yet then we see how it can also be something very representational. and here we spend a lot of time "building trees", forming trees to just the right height and shape, pumping data into it until its leaves are full yet still organized. but in the garden trees grow out of dirt and it grows stems and branches and leaves naturally (what is naturally anyway but in any case without any of our calculations) and soon it is a living thing and we don't need algorithms to keep it balanced. but does it hold data and is this tree the same as that tree, if we may call the tree not a being but a concept and why is it that even our thought processes can be shaped into branches, what came first, the living tree or the conceptual tree-structure?

sources: because my virtual text book is flipped open to a page on B+ trees, because the tree of life, because family trees, because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_(fractal)">fractals can form trees</a> , because even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decisions</a> can be made by trees, and then I spent a few hours <a href="https://github.com/sbchou/AI_Projects/tree/master/decision_tree_learning">making code</a> that makes trees that make decisions, because spring, pollen sneeze]]></content:encoded>

		<title>5 Things I Learned from 10 Years of Competitive Gymnastics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As maybe a few of you know, I had a rather interesting adolescence training as a competitive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmic_gymnastics">Rhythmic Gymnast</a> for 10 years of my life. this included summer training camps in Canada and Russia, along with 20 hours a week of practice in middle school and other such crazy experiences. As it was occasionally traumatizing, most of the time I prefer to shove these memories in the back of my mind. However, sometimes, I do stumble upon them, and think of various things I've gained and/or lost from this decade of my life. Here are a few lessons I've learned, so that you don't have to repeat this long and strenous process yourself: 

1. If a new leader steps in with a cult-inducing personality and tries above all to tout the nationality of their homeland, you should probably be wary.

2. Cliche, but still not stated enough: you can only really excel at doing something if and when you love what you do. This does not mean that the practice has to come easily; often, challenges are essential to enjoyment. However, make sure that the issues you are fighting are worthy pursuits.

3. The toughest enemy you will ever battle will be the one in your own head. The toughest opponent you will ever struggle with will be that of your own body, even if you are a 5-foot tall gymnast.

4. The relentless pursuit of perfectionism is lethal. The enjoyment of life and culture is not only pleasant, but has great artistic and social worth.

5. On the flip side, having faced enough drama and politics within a childhood to last a lifetime, when anyone tries to give me trouble now, I just make like Beyonce and <a target="_blank" href="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsnxqquHGa1ql5diio1_500.gif">think this</a>.

		<title>Gender Bias in Science is a Real Thing</title>
		<link>http://blog.sophiechou.com/2013/gender-bias-in-science-is-a-real-thing/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2013 20:18:08 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are many concepts in the human mind that may indeed be figments of one's imagination: unicorns, flying pigs, and a truly free lunch, for example. Gender bias in math and science, however, is unfortunately not one of these. (That would be called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">gaslighting</a>.)

It is extremely upsetting to hear that there are men, and even more dissapointing, women, out there who cannot grasp the idea that it might in fact be true, and morever, statistically relevant. This is particularly disturbing considering that students at Columbia are often considered some of the brightest and most liberal in America.

Gender bias in math and science is <em>not</em> a myth. (Check out <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/in-other-news-science-continues-to-be-sexist-no-one-is-shocked/">this post of mine</a> a while back, and for more on this topic, <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2013/02/10/gender-bias-in-math/">Cathy's writing</a> on this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/04/science/girls-lead-in-science-exam-but-not-in-the-united-states.html?ref=science">recent infographic</a> in the nytimes on the depressing results of female performance in science exams in the US).

I will not go in depth today about my feelings about natural aptitude in men versus women in Math and Science, because a) I'm in class and b) really tired of ranting this week, which has been endlessly trying on my patience, but I will leave you this: my firm belief is that Self-Doubt is the Number One cause of underachievement with respect to women in technical fields. I say this because I do <em>not</em> believe that natural talent has much to do with scientific success-- only hard work, interest, and a belief in one's ability to learn.

I cannot tell you how many times I've heard women in Computer Science doubt their abilities to code or take courses, myself entirely included in this camp, yet there are very few times I've heard a similiar complaint from men: on all levels of learning. I myself did not become comfortable debating and discussing Computer Science (the most fun and best learning method in <em>any</em> field!) until nearly 2 years after my study began; and that was after I found great female (and male) mentors, and formed a strong friend group and area of interest (Data Science and Natural Language) within the community.

The problem with self-doubt starts <em>very</em> young-- I often find that girls seem to believe they are not "suited" towards math or "no good" at it. Almost always this is untrue. If you do not believe me I will offer myself as an example: I may be no mathematician but, considering that I am currently attending and enjoying Columbia's Engineering school and have accepted a full time paying internship for Data Science this summer, I can pretty safely say that my analytic thinking skills are at least adequate. Yet, up until senior year of high school I always believed myself to dislike math and consider it a non-option; almost all the "math geniuses" I knew were male and had personalities and interests far removed from my own.

These sentiments in my mind were even occasionally echoed by others. When I was a junior in high school my pre-calculus teacher actually refused to recommend me for the more advanced BC AP Calculus class. She told me that I was not "naturally suited" towards mathematics, and had I not had such supportive and encouraging parents (being at that age somewhat obedient towards authoratitive voices who told me I was no good at things) I may have never asked for a waiver. This was, of course, entire BS on her part: not only did I enjoy taking Calculus (I went on to take Calculus III and IV at Columbia), I ended up receiving an "A" in the class. Note that there was <em>no concrete evidence whatsoever </em>in her choice to deny my a recommendation; I had in fact been a stellar student in her class and received an "A+".

I'm not saying that this specific instance was necessarily driven by gender bias; only that if you are a young girl, especially one who is shy and has not yet developed the thick armor necessarily to fend herself from the dissent and criticism prevalent in the perils of daily life; these various doubts on all sides (professors, colleagues, internal) can cumulate and deter a further pursuit of mathematics (or science). Which is a real damn shame.

I only hope that gender bias it will one day go in the way of the unicorn; until then, I will continue to try my best to lead as a good role model and encourage those around me to do the same, or at least die trying. (Hopefully, die of natural causes after a healthy and happy life trying.)

		<title> the terrible and wonderful reasons why i dance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running" target="_blank">this little comic</a> from the Oatmeal, titled “The Terrible & Wonderful Reasons why I run Long Distance” popped up on several friends’ newsfeeds. 

It's a very good piece, and if you are a runner yourself, or maybe a biker, or maybe a swimmer, or maybe just a person, or maybe even a cat of the internet, you should check it out. With the simplest of drawings, it captures very well the essence of an amateur runner.

I myself don't run in the way that the narrator of this comic runs. I run when it's nice outside, I run when I'm frustrated, I run when I'm angry, and I run when I'm lost. But I run very rarely, and never do I run fast enough, or long enough, to reach euphoria. My running is always solo, always complentative, and never has it silenced the noise in my head. Very often, it smoothes tangled knots out-- if only by virtue of making myself feel healthy and sunkissed again.

Recently, I started dancing again. I've been dancing since I was five. When I was three, I watched my older sister's ballet performance and begged my mom to be onstage, too. I love to move, and I love to dance, and in a way dance is a healing process-- after 10 years of competitive gymnastics, I love the feeling of being onstage without having my every step marked by point deductions.

In a moment of sheer luck, I've discovered a rare gem: the Manhattan dance studio that is relatively affordable, air-conditioned, spacious, and most elusive of all, not filled with judgemental, competitive, rail-thin preprofessional teenagers waiting to eat me up. 

The dancers at this studio are very talented. The instructor is friendly and experienced. But best of all, this class-- twice a week, an hour-and-a-half each-- whips the my ass. And it also whips my abs, and my arms, and my calves, and my thighs, and most importantly, my brain.

When I enter the studio directly after work, there's a million thoughts running through my head. <i>Is it bad that I left work before 7? Did I slack off too much today? Will I finish my summer project in time? Do I need a Ph.D? Am I ever going to be a good scientist? Is the world driven by chance or does it have a telos? Is it possible to be both intellectually conscious and happy? </i>

But twenty minutes into class, I'm struggling just to breathe, as this killer warm-up asks me to do thirty more sit-ups, forty more crunches. Bass beats rivet off the ceiling, and sweat drips off my nose.

"I've always considered <i>the</i> question to be 'Why am I alive? Why am I here? What's the point of <i>me?</i> And to that I say: WHO CARES! FORGET THE <i>WHY</i> YOU ARE IN A RAGING FOREST FULL OF BEAUTY AND AGONY...THIS IS BETTER THAN THE <i>WHY.</i> I run because I seek that clarity", <a target="_blank" href="
http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running6">says the little stick figure</a> in the Oatmeal comic.

There is only one reason why I dance. I want, I crave, I <i>need</i> a better way to express myself. (Sometimes, I wish I could sing louder, clearer, just so I could belt it out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZFQgqhNoEI" target="_blank">like Christina Aguilera in Burlesque</a> at the end of a long work day in my little-town-accidentally-sexy waitress outfit. And then become a professional performer with Cher.)

I'm not a great dancer, by any means. Sure, I can bust a few moves at a party. I'm relatively in shape, I've been dancing a long time, and most of all I Love it With All My Heart. I'm a slow learner, I'm a little off-beat, but by show time I'm giving it my all. 

Sometimes, dancing makes me feel very small and adolescent again, while I watch the slim beautiful girls at Barnard and Columbia in my dance group rule the stage with their wonderful years of ballet training and their illuminating stage prescence. And when that happens, the voice of my fourteen-year-old self is telling me again that I'm not thin enough, not blonde enough, and just so damn awkward.

But goddamit, sometimes I like that. Sometimes it's good to worry so much about things that my Computer Science classmates would find trivial, to feel small and nerdy and inadequate again, to feel the ruthless female competition of beauty and grace. Sometimes it's good to want so much to be good at something that isn't just a desk job.

It's a struggle, and so much work, just to be able to express one-tenth of what I want to say in my movement. But in that moment when I'm finally on the beat, and not stumbling over my own feet, I never feel so much alive.

If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it's all "part of the plan". But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds!" -Joker

Poverty, corrupt governments, economic/social/cultural issues, wars, etc leading to the death of hundreds of children, (even more if you count in adults) all over the world hundreds everyday. I am not discounting the passing of those this morning but it leads to that question whether we feel more morally responsible for whole world or only those in the States. Is it less human to favor certain groups over others? 

Maybe now we are "used to" certain things and become numb to them: poverty in Africa, war in the Middle East, sex-trafficking in Brazil, and other atrocities we don't even know about. 

However, I do believe that, universally, no one could provide acclaim for the death of children by murder. But still, the cold yet critical side of me points out  solely to the numbers and then points at our heads and whether they are too swayed by the heart.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/the-prayer-of-an-unconventional-family/">A lovely ode</a> to all those "unconventional families" out there. Really hit a familiar note for a girl who grew up in the library. Life might be easier if we all had PTA moms baking us cookies, but as my Linear Algebra textbook says, "Uniqueness implies existence, and existence implies uniqueness. (Therefore the matrix A is 
invertible.)".

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Preface: I am taking a class in Race and Racism this semester with <a href="http://sallyhaslanger.weebly.com/">Sally Haslanger</a> at MIT, fulfilling my deepest desires of having classes in philosophy count towards my degree. I figured I would cross-post my weekly responses and thoughts here, so that you may read them and form a few thoughts of your own.
</em>

This week’s readings in Race &amp; Racism class have already brought a few new points to my mind concerning this topic, especially on the classification of “race” itself. Now, being a non-white person living in America (although the same likely applies for people of all colors, non-colors, whatever you may choose to designate yourself as) I have already spent a good deal of time (say, about 22 years) rolling this idea of “race” around my brainspace. The events of this summer certainly brought it to the forefront.

Still, in all this time, about 8,000 day’s worth minus a few years of color-blind babyhood, I never really challenged the idea of race itself as a classifier. That, I took for granted. It was handed to me on the first day of grade school: <em>Look, you are the Asian kid in class (there was one other, a boy, I think, so if you want to be specific, I was the Asian Girl); those are the Black kids, these are the Hispanic kids, and I guess, everyone else is White</em>. Racism is bad; everybody knows that, but yea, you’re definitely the Asian kid. Don’t call someone fat, but there’s nothing wrong with saying that someone’s White or Black, it just is.

This is what philosopher Blum (<em>I’m not a Racist, But…, 2002</em>) calls the “popular account”, and it is, he is very clear to state, wrong. Wrong as in false, but also wrong in the sense that it is morally detrimental. What’s wrong with racial thinking? There are a few key points:

1.Racial thinking divides us. It creates “moral distance” among those of different races. i.e. it becomes easier to antagonize the man who is not of my “type”. (102)
2. At the same time, it falsely groups us into categories all too easily stereotyped (103).
3. It suggests that we can’t escape our “racial fate” (i.e. “All Asians are good at math and like engineering”... oops) (104)
4. and finally, racial categories “evoke associations of superiority and inferiority of value”.

I think point 3 is especially important as it leads to the idea of racial immobility, i.e. <em>you are born Asian and you die Asian because your parents are Asian</em>, and this becomes especially harmful when considering statements 1, 2, and 4, unlike all the bad things that class categorization brings, because whereas in some places there is an idea of class mobility, really,<em> I can’t think of many people who might believe in race mobility for a single person (at least not in America), unless they resemble closely enough another</em>. It doesn’t matter how “whitewashed” I am, even if my entire adoptive family is white, if I wake up one morning and declare “I am white!” the person next to me might say in reply: “go the f--k to sleep”.

However, I am not sure that I am completely onboard with Blum’s rejection of racial thinking on a moral stance. It is true that there are many oddities to racial classification that suggest it to be unsound without an implicit cognitive model of race, i.e. <em>why choose skin color and not some other physical attribute (such as hair color), why narrow the world down to essentially 5 races established a long time ago in the 18th century when there are many other groups that are quite distinct</em>, (in fact, I admit I always considered race to be a genetic aspect, and was thoroughly surprised to learn that in fact there is very little genetic distinction between them (<em>Does Race Exist, Bamshad &amp; Olson, 2003</em>)).

But I do not think it is the categorization and classification of people into races itself that is at fault, <em>but how we do this and the assumptions we make while doing so</em>. It is in fact precisely points 1-4 that are <em>what’s wrong with our thinking of race itself, and not the acceptance that race exists</em>. I am not sure there is such thing as a post-racial world. Colorblindness could be in fact, harmful.

Blum points out our reluctance to classify people by race as a hint to the incorrectness of the action, but <em>if we did not associate certain races with negative traits then we might not hesitate so much, just as we might not feel it as taboo to point out, simply, that someone has brown or black hair, which is a way of categorization</em>. Maybe at this point, the use of race is far too entrenched with negativity and harm that there is no more way to use the concept without hurt, but again, <em>this is not in the categorization itself but the attributes we have prescribed to our method of doing so and the categories.</em>

Whether or not race exists biologically, the worst possible thing would be for us to fear acknowledging that it is a very real thing in society. Even in my own conversations, I see this fear of speaking about race, fear of acknowledgment, fear of saying the word itself. This is what creates boundaries between us, not race, the concept.

Maybe the idea of race is all in our head… but that does not make it any less of a reality.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Three years ago, I learned how to print Hello World in Java for the first time.
That semester, I stayed up many late nights crying because I was so frustrated with how hard it was for me to fix even the tiniest of bugs. Everyone in class seemed light-years above me.

Today, I have been accepted to MIT Media Lab's MAS program, and I'll be joining Deb Roy's Cognitive Machines lab this fall. It's truly a nerd dream come true.

I think if my mother taught me one thing, 
it is that 
it is not how successful you are
or how wealthy you are
or even how hard you work that matters.
what matters is how interesting you are
because that is your human value.

And mom, if you're reading this, don't read too hard into it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes I think to myself, wow, I am a lucky girl. 

To be a young student in Manhattan: to have had snippets of summer, to have been to secret speakeasies and after-hours parties at the MOMA, to have taken the cab and the subway in the wee hours of the morning, to sip cocktails under a different age. 

We do not have much in the way of savings but there is nothing richer than the culture of the metropolis, nothing more luxurious than the gold of youth.

Yet, we could be old and still chic. There is nothing preventing us from being so in this great city but our own monotony. We could be grand, we could have dinner parties. We could own even more black dresses and cynicism than we do now. We could never have everything; we could hardly have the rent. But we could have our pride.

These are the stuff of sweet memories, one day we shall recite to our children. Perhaps our first love will sway, but for now, we have never before been so alive.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nowadays it is conventional to believe that emotional eating is unhealthy, but the truth is that emotions are so strongly mixed into every ingredient of a meal that the two are inseparable.

Why is it that our memories of eating are often so much stronger, more vivid than our memories of anything else? First-grade strawberry birthday popsicles. Peanut-butter-and-jelly, half thrown away. Turkey for Thanksgiving, and then cold turkey the whole week after. I don’t remember, really, what dress I wore to the birthday; I don’t remember what I did after lunch in the cafeteria, and I can’t recall that year whether or not Grandma was at our house.

It’s not simply that perhaps I have an irregular preoccupation with food; there are for certain a great deal of people with less interest than I in cooking and dining, but then again also a great deal with more. Eating combines the physical with the social, with which the emotional is undeniably inextricable. Food memories are persistent because they involve strong stimulation of all five physical senses (seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching) all centered around a social function or a cultural dictation; eating a meal is both an event and an action and an indication. The food we eat (along with the food that we do not permit ourselves to consume) form little landmarks in our lives.

On a cloudy, chilly, groggy Friday like this, I pull out the warm memory of a feast at summer’s end. It nourishes my soul. It grounds my mind. It pulls me from the dark, floating, philosophical clouds above, to the concrete, Epicurean joys of physical Earth.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This Thanksgiving dinner, something miraculous happened: <i>I finally felt smart enough to talk to my dad about science</i>.

Now, granted, lest you think I have uncommunicative parents, my dad has been <i>trying</i> to talk to me about science since birth (at 5: do you want to build a computer board with me? now wouldn't that be fun? me: no! i want to play with Barbies). However, it took me a full 20 years of life and 2 and counting years of Ivy league schooling to finally, finally <i>know what he was talking about</i>. 

I feel like this monumental event speaks volumes about a number of important things.

First: that barriers to entry and barriers to culture in science, especially computer science, are, as previously suspected, very very high. I talked a little bit about <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/speaking-in-tongues/">the use of jargon</a> and how it can discourage many new learners before, especially newcomers and women. Keep in mind that my dad is probably <i>the</i> nicest guy I know, and extremely enthusiastic in trying to get his children to be interested in his work, yet previous to this fall, even when I had been coding for more than a year, it was still intimidating and tough to talk to him about my work. 

Second: on the power of being a role model and a huge influence on one's life without ever telling someone what to do. Growing up, I spent a great deal more time with my mother (who didn't work) than my father (who is a night owl and worked way past my elementary school bedtime). Neither of my parents told me what I should study or what sort of career to pursue, and my dad especially never tried to push any sort of academic dogma on me. I always felt that he was incredibly smart but that coding and computer science were something I had neither the aptitude or interest in: plus, since my parent did it, it must be, in some way, decidely uncool.

Fast-foward 20 years and he has two daughters in the hard sciences: one is a ph.d student at Princeton and another in Columbia engineering school. It's especially fun to see how much my area of interest turned out so similiar to my father's work: both of us are either studying or working in the field of Natural Language Processing, and in fact, I am taking a class under the direction of one of his former colleagues during the glory days of Bell Labs. Note that, being stubborn and independent, I <i>never, ever</i> talked to my dad much about what I was studying at school or doing at my summer jobs. He didn't suggest NLP or AI to me; I just sort of fell into it, and loved it. An anecdote to the power of being a good role model. (Cathy talks a bit about a similiar topic on her great post, <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2012/04/08/on-the-making-of-a-girl-nerd/">on the making of a girl nerd</a>.)

Or, perhaps the apple really does never fall far from the tree.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Every day I am thankful but some days I forget. </em>

It is easy to forget and attack the day in steely resolve because life does not take so easily to being loved. We wish for her to be always apple-cheeked and rosy like the girl next door of our childhood dreams: forever preserved in our imaginations, she never loses her temper; her skin always porcelain and clear. 

In reality this is not so. Life, she is complicated. When she frowns upon us it is not always the pout we wish we could adore. There are times when she rages and the rage is geniune, full of hatred, bigotry, and fear. She is full of angst and her complexion polluted by man. She is fickle, she smiles upon the beautiful and the wealthy, and she is unfair: unabashedly so.

Still, we would not have it any other way. (Save, maybe, for the extremely uncreative or extremely boring.) There is no great art without an element of tragedy; there is no great genius without a touch of insanity. In its greatest imperfections and frustrations, Life is most human, most poignant. Only chaos can give birth to a dancing star.

Every day I am thankful for a million different things: a list that could be processed across a dozen parallel computers and still take more than seconds to complete. I can't always recite them but I know they are there. These are just a few.

I am thankful to have a wonderful, caring boss at my work study job who bakes the whole office cake and lets us all know that there is still a place for Southern hospitality in a no-nonsense, metropolitan school.

I am thankful to have parents that are open-minded and loving: it is their eccentricities that make me unique.

I am thankful to have a sister who is my best friend that I talk to everyday just like in books.

I am thankful to have best friends who are like sisters (and brothers). They keep me afloat and are great fun to boot.

I am thankful to be privileged to attend this University; flawed though it may be at times, the knowledge and opportunity is unsurpassable.

I am thankful to have found a field of study that challenges and never fails to fascinate me. I am especially thankful that academic grades are relatively irrelevant in this field.

I am thankful for my good health despite my sleep deprivation and correlated penchant for caffeine and sugar.

I am thankful to wake up in the city that never sleeps, where even shopping for groceries could have taken place in a movie. I never fell in love as a teenager and the City is my first.

Above all I am thankful to be able to put my thoughts into words and those words on a page. This is, perhaps, as Aristotle suspected, what really makes (wo)man (wo)man.

<em>Happy holidays. Take care.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://stemfeminist.com/" target="_blank">Go here now, read and weep</a>. To people who think that sexism in STEM is just hype, let me tell you that unfortunately, I have *NEVER* worked in a single lab or workplace of a technical nature where I have not experienced some sort of sexism-- ranging from inappropriate comments to outright harassment. That is right-- not a SINGLE lab or company. I would say my resume contains places people would consider inspiring, cutting edge, and liberal. Please be respectful and think about that.

Even though I’m practicing my <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/28f54558e0aa55f440ab77a6d3bbab3b/tumblr_mgyk4o0fym1r9w3tqo1_500.png">April Ludgate glare</a> in real life, today I’m going to be more <a href="http://33.media.tumblr.com/0ee77d7f0c4209c7fd27ddc0b7ad6210/tumblr_mpuyyl9Gc61qhy6c9o1_500.gif">like this</a>. Why?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I co-wrote my first paper with two cool cats at MIT CSAIL, <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/wli/">William Li</a> and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rameshvs/">Ramesh Sridharan</a>, and it got accepted to the <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2014/">KDD Conference</a> as a highlight talk!</p>
<p dir="ltr">That means next Sunday, August 24th you can hear me taco ‘bout it in real life at 11am in the Bloomberg Building, 731 Lexington Avenue, NY, NY.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The theme of this year’s conference is “Data Mining for Social Good”, and our paper is a short vision statement on effecting positive social change with data science. We briefly define “Data Science”, ask what it means to democratize the field, and to what end that may be achieved. In other words, the current applications of Data Science, a new but growing field, in both research and industry, has the potential for great social impact, but in reality, resources are rarely distributed in a way to optimize the social good.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The conference on Sunday at Bloomberg is free, and the line-up looks promising. There are three “tracks” going on that morning, “Data Science &amp; Policy”, “Urban Computing”, and “Data Frameworks”. Ours is in the 3rd track. <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2014/program.html">Sign up here</a>!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This semester I have the pleasure of being involved with a pretty cool research project on Government secrecy at Columbia University.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.declassification-engine.org/">The Declassification Engine</a>, which bills itself as “Computational Analysis of Official Secrecy”, is a joint project between the History, Statistics, and Computer Science (specifically Natural Language Processing) departments at CU (among a slew of other things) to provide tools and better analysis of just what the government has and has not (and will and will not) be withholding from the public throughout the years.</p>
<p>I myself found a research position on this project by following my favorite TA in my favorite class on Natural Language Processing into his research life, which is how one often finds interesting things.</p>
<p>The project is still quite young and less rigidly defined, so it’s fun to be involved early.</p>
<p>I’ll be working on image processing and language processing, among other things I really enjoy doing.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I’m a huge proponent of free speech, free press, and transparency, and quite excited. Plus it never hurts to feel like a real badass hacker, ripping through hundreds of thousands of federal censored papers in the terminal.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/declassification-engine/">a recent interview</a> on the Declassification on NPR!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Eight days before my twenty-third birthday, I embarked on what can only be described as a truly magical journey to three completely contrasting cities: Reykjavik, Amsterdam, and Prague. Along the way, I met a number of fascinating characters-- some of them related to me. Here is an excerpt of my great aunt's life, which she handed me a photocopy of on my way to the airport leaving Holland. </em>

<em>* note: <a href="https://readfold.com/read/mpetitchou/a-completely-unbiased-autobiography-by-my-great-aunt-lenore-eTKBD32N">interactive version</a> cross-posted on FOLD, a new publishing platform made by some friends @ the Media Lab.</em>

<strong>Living in Holland</strong>

(a completely unbiased autobiography

written by my great-aunt Lenore

for the AWCA)

<em>I am Cantonese but was born in Shanghai, then and now the most cosmopolitan city of China. Already at birth I was touched by the American brush. Both my parents had studied in the States, my dad receiving degrees from MIT and Case Institute and my mom from Columbia University.</em>

<em>There were seven of us, four girls and three boys. I was ‘sister three’… and we were naughty. One day, to give you an example, our gardener was taking a nap, snoring with his mouth open and we put a spoonful of salt on his tongue. My mom scolded us… severely I might add.</em>

<em>After the happy years trouble came, first, the Japanese occupation and then, finally, the communist takeover. We had to flee and since my dad was Minister of Transportation, he had the use of a government plane and we escaped by flying to Taiwan just in time. This all happened a few months before I was supposed to graduate from high school. Fortunately the government in Taiwan granted my diploma, which enabled me to go study in Michigan.</em>

<em>I enrolled at Michigan State University and turned into a party girl, within the limits of decency. Although I didn’t study too industriously, I succeeded in becoming a member of Pi Mu Epsilon (mathematics honorary), Iota Sigma Pi and Sigma Delta Epsilon (chemistry honoraries).</em>

<em>After obtaining my MS in Physical Chemistry I was ready for the world. But was the world ready for me? I decided they and I were going to find out, but in a somewhat warmer climate than Michigan. Go West young woman! I descended upon innocent Seattle (those were the days) and by my first day I had fond a small apartment and a job at the Analytical Department of the University of Washington. All I needed was a husband. So, I spent my weekends dancing and dating (Sleepless in Seattle). The Chinese boys didn’t want me. They want their women, demure, soft-spoken and obedient. A loud-mouth like me was out of the question. So, I had to turn to other prey. At the foreign students club, Cosmo, I cornered Jack Wiegman, a student at the School of Communications, and made him my husband, like it or not.</em>

<em>After he graduated, we moved to New York, where I found a job at my mom’s alma mater, Columbia University. After only one year, out of the blue, I was approached by American Cyanamid, Princeton, NJ, who invited me to an interview and then offered me a position as a research chemist. I succeeded to invent two chemical processes. My boss quickly put his name to one and the other one I was forced to sell for the generous sum of one dollar.</em>

<em>My husband was transferred to Amsterdam and so I was back at point zero. I decided to interrupt my career by having a son. However, when he was two and an intelligent big boy, I felt he was ready for kindergarten and, for me, it was time to resume my career by joining a division of the Dutch Akzo Chemical Corporation in Amsterdam. To put it mildly: I didn’t like it at all. Fortunately, after almost two years, opportunity struck by way of an ad for a position as a research chemist at the Dental Materials Science Department of the University of Amsterdam. Thanks to my work in the States I was chosen among 40 candidates to become Hoofdmedewerker which you could roughly translate as Associate Professor. This you could call the turning point of my life. I came up with two more inventions but— it’s an old story— the head of the department tried to usurp the credit. I fought all the way to the Board of the University and won, but, of course, I had to move. I joined the Electrochemistry Department where I started in a PhD program. In 1979, I obtained the degree with the thesis “The Kinetics of the Hydration of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate and Cement, investigated by an Electrical Resistance Method”. (Wow)</em>

<em>To complete the bragging: I am listed in the Marquis Who’s Who in Science and Engineering (US) and also in the International Biographical Centre (Cambridge, England). I also have been a long-time member of the ACS (American Chemical Society).</em>

<em>Six years ago I suffered a stroke. Since then I’ve been confined to a wheelchair.</em>

<em>Now, I have time to catch up on reading and to play with my grandchildren who live in the same building, a canal house on Keizersgracht. And then, of course, there is the AWCA of which I have been a member 29 years.</em>

		<title>the challenges of large-scale ethical gender identification</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2014/our-machines-our-selves/">last post</a>, I lamented a bit the potential for advanced technologies to reinforce existing biases at a quicker and larger scale, without either our awareness nor consent.

The issue of algorithmically detecting gender that I briefly mentioned is one that I've been struggling with this semester. Inferring gender can be crucial in revealing lags at publications and harmful disparities in behavior where diversity data is not provided, yet the act of classification can be morally and socially harmful.

<a href="http://natematias.com/">Nathan Matias</a> is a Ph.D student at the neighboring Civic Media Lab who has been a great ally in helping soften the steep learning curve of grad school and also in tackling gender/identity related projects. His master's thesis work in <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/20120284/">Open Gender Tracker</a> has led to many great posts on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nathan-matias+news/datablog">the Guardian's Datablog</a>.

Like a truly great friend, he not only answered my questions with regard to ethically detecting gender, he wrote a <a href="https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/how-to-identify-gender-in-datasets-at-large-scales-ethically-and-responsibly">comprehensive blogpost</a> about it. He highlights the practical realities of keeping work both computationally effective and ethically responsible. A must-read for anyone considering work in this area. Thank you Nathan!
