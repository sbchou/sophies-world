    <p><em>Hello, World!</em><br />
<em></em>Welcome to my new blog! Sitting in a cafe near Union Square &amp; sipping on some iced coconut chai, I figure now is a good time as ever to start posting. Life is good.</p>
<p><em>Why blog?</em><br />
This blog was partly inspired by my short-term mentor this summer, Cathy O'Neil, who has a brilliant and witty blog at <a href="http://mathbabe.org/">Mathbabe.org</a>. I have always considered myself a writer at heart (and by that I do not mean a good writer, or even a prolific one; just someone who expresses themselves best via the written word), but as a Computer Scientist in training do not find myself writing as often as I'd like to. For a few years now, I've maintained my food blog, <a href="http://www.mpetitchou.com/">Mon Petit Chou</a>, but other topics (rants &amp; raves, tech stuff, opinion pieces) didn't seem to fit in quite well there.</p>
<p><em>A little bit about me:</em><br />
Hello, my name is Sophie. I am a Computer Science major (and hopefully Philosophy minor) at Columbia University's Engineering School. This summer, I am a <a href="http://hackny.org/">hackNY fellows</a> working as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.intentmedia.com/">Intent Media</a>. Am a bit of a feminist, love to read (although have not read as much since I started working), been dancing since I was a little girl, although not professionally/intensly. What else... foodie, cat lover, writer (of course). That's about it.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, please leave COMMENTS! They're the best part about writing.</p>
<p><em>Now, for a little bit of nerdspeak:</em><br />
For you hackers out there, this blog is indeed run on Wordpress. Now, Wordpress is a bit of a hacker's nightmare: php and annoying UI's all over the place. Since my food blog is run on Wordpress, and I knew the faults, I considered creating a static blog using Jekyll (perhaps Octopress or Jekyll-Bootstrap), which are both great because it meant blogging would fit right into my work flow: simply git add, commit, and push, and voila, new post! I'd never have to leave the terminal. However, after tinkering around with it for a while, I realized that, fun as it was, it simply wasn't practical at this time: basically, I wouldn't be able to blog from the remote, and the conviniences of using a pre-packaged software simply outweighted the benefits in the end.</p>
<p>However, do not despair: in the spirit of all things hacky, even though I did sucumb to Wordpress, this blog is actually hosted (for free!) on Heroku, yay! Checkout this awesome repo by mhoofman on Github (<a href="https://github.com/mhoofman/wordpress-heroku">https://github.com/mhoofman/wordpress-heroku</a>). It comes with PostgreSQL for Wordpress pre-installed in order to run on Heroku's Postgres backend, and is easy-peasy as pie to setup.</p>
<p>À bientôt!<br />
Sophie</p>
