    <p>How ironic it is that 2 weeks ago I wrote an article on How Women Can't Have it All, when I was, in fact, on my way to breaking point.</p>
<p>These past 2 weeks have been hellish to say the least.</p>
<p>The workload at Columbia has always been tough but I never envisioned how brutal it would be taking 2 graduate level courses along with 3 other programming intensive classes. Perhaps there are some who can handle it, but I do not have the build for it...</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I have never placed too much value in letter and number grades and so the stress was really purely situational and not the blame of perfectionism, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I <em>am</em> am a bit of an academic "purist" and have always loved learning for learning's sake--thus placing a great emotional investment in what I study, especially towards Computer Science and Philosophy, which are my two main interests and have become part of my identity. And so perhaps that is even more of a burden than the pursuit of numbers, as it pains my soul not to learn what interests me well.</p>
<p>And identity, I realize, is integral to the issue. All my life I have been involved in very artistic and expressive pursuits, and so it has always been a secret fear in the back of my head after I started seriously dedicating my studies to the hard sciences I would lose part of myself. Close-minded stereotypes and assumptions of Engineering students I discovered existed after arriving to college did not help. So I imposed concrete, tangible markers on my self-- a minor in Philosophy, Writing for the Spectator-- to make sure someone, something else aside from me would be putting checks on my identity and keep it from slipping away to monotony.</p>
<p>On the one hand, dance (ballet classes and student groups), writing (for my blog and for the Spec) and philosophy (the Ethics class which I am taking, which I adore), have been saving graces in overwhelming times.</p>
<p>I remember one morning waking up so exhausted and sleep deprived that I had the terrifying revelation that <em>I could not get myself to feel anything at all</em>. I wandered through my morning in a stupor--unable to empathize with any human being. It was incredibly disorienting. The moment I finally regained my sense of humanity was when I walked into my ethic professor's office hours. In the sunny room, in the mahogany Philosophy Hall, we had a great conversation on normative ethics and I finally felt myself again.</p>
<p>But on the other side, I realize that I am stretching myself way too thin just to hold on to these societally imposed, arbitrary markers on myself. And so I have withdrawn from my position as a blogger at the Spec*, and have dropped my Philosophy minor, even though it pains me to do so. Health comes first, existence precedes identity (arguably). I can still grow as a writer on my own time, and read great works at my leisure, perhaps auditing courses as life permits.</p>
<p>Dimensionality comes foremost from dimensionality in <em>thought</em> and an open mind-- which can barely be achieved when it is overworked and undernourished.</p>
<p>I hope to keep these things in mind, as I learn to worry less about the labels I place on myself. Quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Thank you friends and family for being infinitely valuable.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>* <em>On a separate, but related note, I have learned a valuable lesson from writing for a web publication-- please be insightful but always respectful whenever commenting on the Internet. Anonymity need not make assholes of us all.</em></p>
