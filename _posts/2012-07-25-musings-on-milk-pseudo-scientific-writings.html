<p>During lunch break I came upon <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/more-on-milk/">this</a> article by one of favorite chefs <a href="http://markbittman.com/">Mark Bittman</a>, which is actually a follow up to his original article, <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/got-milk-you-dont-need-it/"> Got Milk? You Don't Need It</a>. Basically, Bittman talks about how we don't really need to drink milk or eat dairy, which can actually cause many health problems in adults, but it's become a staple due to aggressive marketing, the Big Dairy Industry, the Government, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Note that I said Mark Bittman was one of my favorite <em>chefs</em> and not writers, because unlike his remarkably simple, clear and delicious recipes, I feel that he could execute his words with a bit more tact. Bittman is known for being a pioneer in food activism, and I am in fact a big supporter with many (if not all) of the causes he champions, which are really integral to making Americans more aware of their detrimental consumptions. I'm definitely of his no-milk stance, as I've never really enjoyed drinking milk either, and have found it to cause me stomach upset. (Now, ice cream, that's a different story. Total addict!)</p>
<p>But it's really hard for me to stomach (ha ha) any writing that uses personal anectodes to prove a potentially scientific point, which dairy intolerance most certainly is. Writing something as such will only lead to dozens (in this case, literally thousands!) of comments from psuedo-experts, quack doctors, crotchety old men/women who grew up with the slogan 3-a-day, etc. I'm not about to go all stubborn scientist on you, but look, as someone who studies Computer Science in an Engineering school maybe (just maybe) I'm a little bit of a hard-science snob with a capital S.</p>
<p>All in all, though, I'm not really too miffed, since I do like Bittman's food, and I definitely think this blind American reverence of dairy as some kind of wholesome food of the gods can't be so hot. And hey, if the goal was reverse-psychology, it's definitely done it's trick: nothing like a good dose of pseudo-science to get me all riled up and spreading the word. Such a potentially strong statement definitely deserves some thorough research.</p>
<p>Random nerd rant of the day:<br />
What's the deal with HTML and whitespace? It always bothers me to no end that the assignment operator (=) is stuck right next to the variable, like &lt;div id="value"&gt;. (Why not div id = "value"?).  I'm no expert of HTML style &amp; syntax but it seems to be the norm. (And, for good measure, <a href="http://churchm.ag/if-programming-languages-were-essays-comic/">a little comic</a> that's semi-related).</p>
