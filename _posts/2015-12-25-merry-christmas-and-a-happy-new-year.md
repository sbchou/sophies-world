![TEST CAKE]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/test-cake.jpg)

<p>Two pieces today.</p>
<p>Take <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/opinion/moments-of-grace-in-a-grim-year.html" target="_blank">this one</a> with your morning coffee and cake-- it's Christmas Day, and whether you celebrate or not, you need something sweet because you deserve it.</p>
<p>Then, when you're fully caffeinated and ready to face the New Year and the end of civilization as we know it, read "<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/" target="_blank">Learning to Die in the Anthropocene</a>." Sometimes, you need to look down into the abyss-- I promise that you'll still have to go to work tomorrow. So it goes.</p>
