<p>but what is more of a tragedy than anything is the state of mental healthcare and the lack of prevention for these sorts of crimes in our society.</p>
<p>one is free to antagonize whomever one wishes to. yet i believe in my heart that no sane, or even insane human being would act in such a way unless he or she felt that there was <i>no other choice</i>. this is America, land of choices. but matters of death are often about the lack thereof-- or feeling that way, which i believe to be, for all intents and purposes, practically equivalent (you may argue with me on a different day). and whose good judgement may we call to mark another as insane?</p>
<p>it is a shame, and a tragedy. may those wounded heal, and those killed rest in peace.</p>
