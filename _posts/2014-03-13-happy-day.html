<p>Three years ago, I learned how to print Hello World in Java for the first time.<br />
That semester, I stayed up many late nights crying because I was so frustrated with how hard it was for me to fix even the tiniest of bugs. Everyone in class seemed light-years above me.</p>
<p>Today, I have been accepted to MIT Media Lab's MAS program, and I'll be joining Deb Roy's Cognitive Machines lab this fall. It's truly a nerd dream come true.</p>
<p>I think if my mother taught me one thing,<br />
it is that<br />
it is not how successful you are<br />
or how wealthy you are<br />
or even how hard you work that matters.<br />
what matters is how interesting you are<br />
because that is your human value.</p>
<p>And mom, if you're reading this, don't read too hard into it.</p>
