<p>This Thanksgiving dinner, something miraculous happened: <i>I finally felt smart enough to talk to my dad about science</i>.</p>
<p>Now, granted, lest you think I have uncommunicative parents, my dad has been <i>trying</i> to talk to me about science since birth (at 5: do you want to build a computer board with me? now wouldn't that be fun? me: no! i want to play with Barbies). However, it took me a full 20 years of life and 2 and counting years of Ivy league schooling to finally, finally <i>know what he was talking about</i>. </p>
<p>I feel like this monumental event speaks volumes about a number of important things.</p>
<p>First: that barriers to entry and barriers to culture in science, especially computer science, are, as previously suspected, very very high. I talked a little bit about <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/speaking-in-tongues/">the use of jargon</a> and how it can discourage many new learners before, especially newcomers and women. Keep in mind that my dad is probably <i>the</i> nicest guy I know, and extremely enthusiastic in trying to get his children to be interested in his work, yet previous to this fall, even when I had been coding for more than a year, it was still intimidating and tough to talk to him about my work. </p>
<p>Second: on the power of being a role model and a huge influence on one's life without ever telling someone what to do. Growing up, I spent a great deal more time with my mother (who didn't work) than my father (who is a night owl and worked way past my elementary school bedtime). Neither of my parents told me what I should study or what sort of career to pursue, and my dad especially never tried to push any sort of academic dogma on me. I always felt that he was incredibly smart but that coding and computer science were something I had neither the aptitude or interest in: plus, since my parent did it, it must be, in some way, decidely uncool.</p>
<p>Fast-foward 20 years and he has two daughters in the hard sciences: one is a ph.d student at Princeton and another in Columbia engineering school. It's especially fun to see how much my area of interest turned out so similiar to my father's work: both of us are either studying or working in the field of Natural Language Processing, and in fact, I am taking a class under the direction of one of his former colleagues during the glory days of Bell Labs. Note that, being stubborn and independent, I <i>never, ever</i> talked to my dad much about what I was studying at school or doing at my summer jobs. He didn't suggest NLP or AI to me; I just sort of fell into it, and loved it. An anecdote to the power of being a good role model. (Cathy talks a bit about a similiar topic on her great post, <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2012/04/08/on-the-making-of-a-girl-nerd/">on the making of a girl nerd</a>.)</p>
<p>Or, perhaps the apple really does never fall far from the tree.</p>
