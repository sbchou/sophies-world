<p><a href="http://stemfeminist.com/" target="_blank">Go here now, read and weep</a>. To people who think that sexism in STEM is just hype, let me tell you that unfortunately, I have *NEVER* worked in a single lab or workplace of a technical nature where I have not experienced some sort of sexism-- ranging from inappropriate comments to outright harassment. That is right-- not a SINGLE lab or company. I would say my resume contains places people would consider inspiring, cutting edge, and liberal. Please be respectful and think about that.</p>
