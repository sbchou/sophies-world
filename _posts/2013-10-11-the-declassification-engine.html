<p>This semester I have the pleasure of being involved with a pretty cool research project on Government secrecy at Columbia University.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.declassification-engine.org/">The Declassification Engine</a>, which bills itself as “Computational Analysis of Official Secrecy”, is a joint project between the History, Statistics, and Computer Science (specifically Natural Language Processing) departments at CU (among a slew of other things) to provide tools and better analysis of just what the government has and has not (and will and will not) be withholding from the public throughout the years.</p>
<p>I myself found a research position on this project by following my favorite TA in my favorite class on Natural Language Processing into his research life, which is how one often finds interesting things.</p>
<p>The project is still quite young and less rigidly defined, so it’s fun to be involved early.</p>
<p>I’ll be working on image processing and language processing, among other things I really enjoy doing.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I’m a huge proponent of free speech, free press, and transparency, and quite excited. Plus it never hurts to feel like a real badass hacker, ripping through hundreds of thousands of federal censored papers in the terminal.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/declassification-engine/">a recent interview</a> on the Declassification on NPR!</p>
