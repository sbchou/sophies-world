<p>Forgive me for the brevity, typos, and lack of filter: my brain has been wrapped around and fully defeated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning">Online Mistake-Bound Learning Models</a> and log base 2's and omega bounds and other uncomprehensible things in the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a nifty little article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/science/bias-persists-against-women-of-science-a-study-says.html">NYtimes</a> reporting a study about how not only were men likely to judge female students as less competent in the scientists, but <em>female</em> professors as well.</p>
<p>Does this really come as any surprise? Pretty sure that if 50% of the world tells you that you are scientifically less suited to a certain way of thinking, which is, by the way, entirely false, it doesn't take long for the other 50% to view these stereotypes as true. Too sleepy right now to expand on that but my mentor this summer aka <a href="www.mathbabe.org">Mathbabe</a> wrote a <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2012/02/06/women-in-math/">wonderful and far more thought-out piece</a> about the stereotype of women in math. Combine that with traditional concepts of femninity ("pushiness" is a turn-off, confidence is aggressive, to be scientific is to be cold) and you have a pretty surefire way to undermine confidence and perpetuate negative thinking.</p>
<p>Finally, two small anecdotes before I nap:</p>
<p>First, I was in a computer science program this summer with a male:female ratio of students of about 10:1 onsite, and I can tell you firsthand it is very hard to compete with the self-confidence of a 20-something white male, and ergo, very easy to be overcome by self-doubt, especially if you are timid. The entrepreneur is an especially cocky breed. Sorry, that was rude, I hope no one takes offense, and I do love you all. And I apologize for neither my apology nor my statement.</p>
<p>Second anecdote: I was in a study group last night with three other very intelligent, outgoing girls for aforementioned problem set, and somewhere around 2 am and the 10th proof in, the topic came to topic of female attractiveness w.r.t. men (because yes I am a normal college-age girl and not a robot). Anyway, it came as a suprise to me (or maybe not really a suprise) that it was heavily insisted upon that appearing "vunerable" was attractive. While I would probably agree that this is true, it made me slightly sad. Vunerability is of course what makes us human and lovable, but the idea that you might want to appear slightly weaker than you are in order to catch someone's eye or heart could be potentially dangerous. Deception, of course, is not admirable; yet trying to actually <em>be</em> weaker is more than frightening.</p>
