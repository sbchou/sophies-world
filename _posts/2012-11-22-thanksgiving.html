<p><em>Every day I am thankful but some days I forget. </em></p>
<p>It is easy to forget and attack the day in steely resolve because life does not take so easily to being loved. We wish for her to be always apple-cheeked and rosy like the girl next door of our childhood dreams: forever preserved in our imaginations, she never loses her temper; her skin always porcelain and clear. </p>
<p>In reality this is not so. Life, she is complicated. When she frowns upon us it is not always the pout we wish we could adore. There are times when she rages and the rage is geniune, full of hatred, bigotry, and fear. She is full of angst and her complexion polluted by man. She is fickle, she smiles upon the beautiful and the wealthy, and she is unfair: unabashedly so.</p>
<p>Still, we would not have it any other way. (Save, maybe, for the extremely uncreative or extremely boring.) There is no great art without an element of tragedy; there is no great genius without a touch of insanity. In its greatest imperfections and frustrations, Life is most human, most poignant. Only chaos can give birth to a dancing star.</p>
<p>Every day I am thankful for a million different things: a list that could be processed across a dozen parallel computers and still take more than seconds to complete. I can't always recite them but I know they are there. These are just a few.</p>
<p>I am thankful to have a wonderful, caring boss at my work study job who bakes the whole office cake and lets us all know that there is still a place for Southern hospitality in a no-nonsense, metropolitan school.</p>
<p>I am thankful to have parents that are open-minded and loving: it is their eccentricities that make me unique.</p>
<p>I am thankful to have a sister who is my best friend that I talk to everyday just like in books.</p>
<p>I am thankful to have best friends who are like sisters (and brothers). They keep me afloat and are great fun to boot.</p>
<p>I am thankful to be privileged to attend this University; flawed though it may be at times, the knowledge and opportunity is unsurpassable.</p>
<p>I am thankful to have found a field of study that challenges and never fails to fascinate me. I am especially thankful that academic grades are relatively irrelevant in this field.</p>
<p>I am thankful for my good health despite my sleep deprivation and correlated penchant for caffeine and sugar.</p>
<p>I am thankful to wake up in the city that never sleeps, where even shopping for groceries could have taken place in a movie. I never fell in love as a teenager and the City is my first.</p>
<p>Above all I am thankful to be able to put my thoughts into words and those words on a page. This is, perhaps, as Aristotle suspected, what really makes (wo)man (wo)man.</p>
<p><em>Happy holidays. Take care.<br />
</em></p>
