<p>My newest writing piece: <a href="http://bit.ly/mattycarroll">a profile</a> on Pulitzer-winning data reporter, coffee-addict and Bostonian Matt Carroll! Â His story is being told in <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spotlight_2015/">Spotlight</a>, a movie that has rave reviews and is in theatres now.</p>
