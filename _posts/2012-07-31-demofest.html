<p>phew! it's been a crazy, epic, sleepless week in the City. I can't believe that my summer internship is over and I'm no longer living with all the hackNY fellows. I just got back to the 'burbs yesterday and already I miss the energy. I miss working, and I miss my friends. NYC has made me a city girl through and through. And even though I know I have much left to learn, the thought of going back to school makes me feel uncomfortable. I like being a working woman. I like being part of a team, and I like getting stuff done.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough nostalgia: here's a video of the hackNY 2012 Demofest if you missed it live! My work begins at around 37:00. Definitely needed more rehearsal but  I hope you enjoy!</p>
