<p>I started reading Kurt Vonnegut today. Slaughterhouse Five, anyone familiar? Never read any Vonnegut before, but I bought it off this guy who sells books on a cart for a dollar or five in front of NYU Stern business school. When I bought it off him I did not notice but apparently my friend said the week before his wrists were bandaged as if they had been slashed.</p>
<p>What a voice this Vonnegut has. I am only on the seventh page so I do not know for sure yet but I think he writes about war. His syntax reminds me of Joseph Heller's.</p>
