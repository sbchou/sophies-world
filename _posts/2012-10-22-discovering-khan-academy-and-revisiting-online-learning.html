<p>I'm going to make this short and sweet because I am techinically in Ethics recitation right now but 8 pm is way too late for any non-nocturnal attention span, in my opnion.</p>
<p>A few months ago I wrote <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/thoughts-on-online-learning-and-the-value-of-a-college-degree/">a few thoughts</a> on Coursera and other online learning companies. You can read my critique <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/thoughts-on-online-learning-and-the-value-of-a-college-degree/">here</a> and also the thoughts of <a href="http://blog.sophiechou.com/2012/some-other-voices-on-online-learning/">another writer</a>. In short, I argued that the idea of free knowledge is highly valueable, however virtual learning can never replace the priceless benefits of human-to-human interaction, and points to a serious need to <i>raise</i> the quality of university education.</p>
<p>At the time, I had never taken any online courses before or tried any of the programs. On principle I almost always prefer to speak with and learn from people in the flesh, and tend to be attracted to traditional modes of communication (paperback over e-book, etc.).</p>
<p>Fast forward to midterm season, where I suddenly find myself knee-deep in upcoming tests and no idea whatsoever of what the heck Gaussian-Jordan Elmination or the column space of a matrix is. My Linear Algebra professor, although incredibly well-meaning and intelligent, has a thick accent and ultimately a teaching style I just can't swallow. In come <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a> and <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">MIT Open Courseware</a> to the rescue-- concise, clear lectures (including those by the author of the textbook!) available on re-wind and at my desk. 5 hours of youTube videos later, my problem set no longer looks like a headache in matrix form.</p>
<p>I don't recant any of the things I previously stated. All the issues that I brought up remain unsolved. However, the potential of virtual education may be greater-- and more exciting-- than I previously imagined, and neither scary nor robotic. If there's a topic you need brushing up on or a subject that intruiges you, definitely don't hesitate to give it a try. This does not mean, however, that we need do away with the concrete classroom environment, only that both areas of education (virtual and traditional) remain endlessly improvable.</p>
