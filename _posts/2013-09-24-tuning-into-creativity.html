<p>I guess I haven't blogged in a long time because a) I've been busy and b) I'm hesitant to write unless I have something worthwhile to say. And while it is fun to rant, I want to avoid ranting my head off, because I do feel as if all I say ends up being a first-world problem sort of thing I need to re-evaluate my writing. It is as important to me to become a better writer as it is to get my thoughts across, and questions I want to ask myself more often are: <em>is this even good journalism</em>? And if not journalism, is this good fiction? Non-fiction? Etc. </p>
<p>As I begin senior year, I finally have some space for electives, and as a result I'm trying to work on stretching my creativity in my spare time. This means just living with a sense of orbiting in a slightly different sphere than I do when I'm in hardcore analytic mode. I'm not sure if that even makes sense at all but it's 1:30 am right now and I'm avoiding my problem set.</p>
<p>The only analogy I have is this:<br />
If you're bilingual, do you know that feeling, where you kind of just "tune in" to another language, not even switch gears but just slightly adjust the radio knob to receive a different wavelength? That's how I feel about the creative state of mind. You know that it's there and a language you can speak but there are others equally adequate and all of them interesting to use, but also that if you don't speak it for a while all of a sudden you're fumbling over verbs and names. Whatever language you use in your daily life will be the easiest and sharpest tool, but you know the feelings of the words and sounds of the mother tongue.</p>
<p>OK. That was also probably incoherent. Mostly I just mean that I'm trying to dedicate real time and effort to work on bending the only real Medium I possess on this Earth-- my body (and mind) to wring out even an ounce of art (and by art I mean feeling) from it: whether it be through movement, drawing, or fiction. I'm trying to really work on some purely expressive forms.</p>
<p>Guten Nacht!</p>
