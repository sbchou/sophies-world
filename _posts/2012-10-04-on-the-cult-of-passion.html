<p>This is a little late in coming, but I really, really like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/jobs/follow-a-career-passion-let-it-follow-you.html?smid=tw-share">this article</a> published in the nytimes. Without going into too much detail, since I highly encourage you to read it yourself, the piece, titled "Follow a Career Passion? Let it Follow You" debunks the idea that in order to be successful, you have to start chasing after that <b>one</b> and only dream job, something the author, CS professor at Georgetown Cal Newport calls "the Cult of Passion".</p>
<p>I see a lot of the detrimental effects of this "Cult" at Columbia. I, too, fell victim to its pressures when I was first starting out in Engineering school. I have always been a passionate learner and somewhat an academic "purist": learning for learning's sake, never for grades or awards. When I arrived at Columbia, for the first time in my life, I hated all of my classes. It destroyed my morale. The one course that I truly enjoyed-- a writing seminar-- ironically, caused me even <i>more</i> anxiety, since it had naught to do whatsoever with Engineering.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with encouraging young adults to pursue their dreams or find careers that inspire them. This is all very good and ideal. The old adage holds true: if you are doing something that you love, you <i>are</i> successful already.</p>
<p>However, this philosophy can be problematic because it puts unwarranted stress on career decisions, and moreover, really hurts those who have not yet "discovered" their "calling", which I think is a BS idea anyway. Combine that with the financial and societal pressure that comes with attending an elite school, and you have a lot of Ivy-League tears. It is nearly impossible to know at age 18 or 20 what you want to do for the rest of your life and <i>that's okay</i>: you <i>can't</i> know and if you do, you're probably wrong. </p>
<p>The issue is intensified when very smart, very passionate indivduals have not yet figured out what makes them happy or what exact field they are enthusiastic about. In these situations, and under high pressure, the urge to slap on the passions of others-- perhaps a parent or a professor-- or subsitute alternate motives (money, power) becomes all too tempting. For those with a high drive to succeed and perfectionist tendencies, the option to quit or reevaluate, even when unhappiness ensues, may never occur. I am, and remain, highly doubtful that a career, or moreover life, driven by any of these motives could ever be truly fulfilling or even healthy.</p>
<p>Newport, now a professor, argues that his love for teaching has "nothing to do with figuring out at an early age that I was meant to be a professor", or even that there was anything special about his particular career path. The qualities that cause satisfaction in a career can be found in many areas-- and most of all, <i>they have to be earned</i>. What matters is not the choice you make-- but what you do once you have made the choice.</p>
<p>I could not agree more. I do not often use the word "love", but I say it without qualms that I truly love Computer Science. It is a fascinating field of study and I am an eager evangelist. In it I see reflections of myself: the connections to Plato and Aristotle through logic and philosophy, the magic of words and drafting something beautiful that I crave in writing. Sure, there is a lot of debugging and frustration in between, but it satisfies, and most of all, challenges me to be a better thinker. None of these traits are apparent to the non-Computer Scientist or even many Computer Scientists. That's because I took something that piqued <i>my</i> interests, and molded it into a passion.</p>
<p>I don't know if I want to be a developer 5 years, or even 2 years (after graduation), from now. That's because there is never only one right way or one right answer-- not even in science. I don't even know if my enthusiasm or GPA will survive this brutal semester of for and while loops. But I do know for sure that when it comes time to reeavaluate, I will try my best not to worry-- because I know that where hard work and dedication go, love will follow.</p>
