<p><a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/the-prayer-of-an-unconventional-family/">A lovely ode</a> to all those "unconventional families" out there. Really hit a familiar note for a girl who grew up in the library. Life might be easier if we all had PTA moms baking us cookies, but as my Linear Algebra textbook says, "Uniqueness implies existence, and existence implies uniqueness. (Therefore the matrix A is<br />
invertible.)".</p>
<p>[<em>pet peeve: why in MLA format must punctuation go outside the quote? well, I don't like it.</em>]</p>
