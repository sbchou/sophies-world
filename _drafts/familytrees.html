<p>*caution: written while sleep deprived</p>
<p>every once in a while i'll have a word or two or maybe even a little phrase pop (no, more like slowly emerge) into my head and it will stick around for a week or so. actually, it's usually more of a thought snippet, a concept, an idea, but maybe everything is words because our thoughts in our brains are formed by words just like computer code stripped down to its barest is always just 1's and 0's.</p>
<p>then this word, phrase, thought, idea gently but firmly wraps over all the other thoughts running through my brain so that all the items are still there but there's a concrete yet transparent filament over it all making the view a little tinted, so you always see things in a slightly different hue. and so when there's not much going on, or maybe very much but very boring stuff, you can see the color most clearly.</p>
<p>anyway. two small creatures like that have been running through my mind lately, two words: families and trees. and maybe a third if you add the two together, family trees.</p>
<p>families</p>
<p>happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. but really are any families happy families? are they happy if the people within them are individually happy or is a happy family one that functions well within its frame? i do not know if there exists one single person who has a soley saccharine feeling towards one's family, (that within itself would be a cause for concern, because then we ask, does this person love his mother/father/child too much?) yet we all seem to love them regardless very much, (or in the least case attribute a great deal to them, whether it be good or bad) arguably even more so for there is satisfaction to be found in disagreement.  </p>
<p>i don't know around from around age 13 to age 24 or so i feel like one's job is to wean away from one's family, even strictly biologically yet still retaining this inner since of pride for one's relations (and the more belligerent they are how could you not) and somehow if we may be like human objects somewhere hidden inside there's always this invisible pointer to one's mother and father and them to theirs and through them siblings and cousins </p>
<p>sources: brunch with my immediate family for the first time in a long time, a re-kindled hobby of googling my second cousin <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/newphotography/amanda-ross-ho/">amanda's work</a> on the internet, after her exhibit popped into my virtual mailbox via <a href="http://artcards.cc/">ArtCards</a>, our inheirent fascinations with ancestries, and because Freud said so</p>
<p>trees</p>
<p>the tree is a source of fascination because it is for most frequent uses of the word something very natural and physical yet then we see how it can also be something very representational. and here we spend a lot of time "building trees", forming trees to just the right height and shape, pumping data into it until its leaves are full yet still organized. but in the garden trees grow out of dirt and it grows stems and branches and leaves naturally (what is naturally anyway but in any case without any of our calculations) and soon it is a living thing and we don't need algorithms to keep it balanced. but does it hold data and is this tree the same as that tree, if we may call the tree not a being but a concept and why is it that even our thought processes can be shaped into branches, what came first, the living tree or the conceptual tree-structure?</p>
<p>sources: because my virtual text book is flipped open to a page on B+ trees, because the tree of life, because family trees, because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_(fractal)">fractals can form trees</a> , because even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decisions</a> can be made by trees, and then I spent a few hours <a href="https://github.com/sbchou/AI_Projects/tree/master/decision_tree_learning">making code</a> that makes trees that make decisions, because spring, pollen sneeze</p>
